So, recording live sessions. We've already talked about recording
in hangouts and I've already waxed lyrical about why we should
record as I say I think it's fantastic evidence
that work's being done ... both if you're trying to demonstrate to your ...
whatever, your community, to your seniors, to your supervisor, to your professor or
whatever it is ... a video of you actually doing the work
really shows that you did the work ... it also
allows others potentially to benefit from what you worked out ...
it's ... recording of a live session
I think it's not necessarily as good as ...
for example a RailsCast where ... or a really highly polished
thing where someone is showing you step by step how to work through on something.
What it does ...
I think it's really useful to see just other people's environments; how they work
out
the approach that they take; their thought process ... I think it's fascinating ... I just
continue to love to see
so many other people's processes ... and
it's also you know ... you may say: "Well you know the videos not much
benefit for me,
you know I'm not going to look at it" ... if you are working with some piece of software
you're working with some online course that's being delivered. If you're
recording yourself
encountering the issue that you encounter. I mean it's just fantastic for
submitting bug reports. I mean rather than saying:
"You know I had this issue" and then spending fifteen minutes typing out and adding
screenshots for exactly what happened and your whole
flow ... a short five-minute video of "I encountered this issue
and here's the link to the unlisted YouTube of it ...
or even public YouTube if it's a public service and you're saying "Like, look
you know this main thing is broken with G+" or what have you ...
really goes a long way. So ... you may be in the situation
that you can't
Hangout, stream, for whatever reason may be you can't get a YouTube verified account
maybe YouTube is banned in your country ... there are a lot of alternatives. I mean we ...
I mean I'm a big fan of Hangouts mainly because
its ... I don't have to then do the upload
of the software. I use as I am now
for recording this session I'm using Screencast-O-Matic
... there's a free version. I'm using the pro version here which is like
15 dollars
and I've been using that ... pretty much ...
I think I used to use ScreenFlow on
on Mac and ... yeah
why did I switch to Screencast-O-Matic ...
I mean the ScreenFlow was Mac only ... I think the particular thing at the time
ScreenFlow
which is a Mac system just seemed to take a lot longer to do certain sorts of
things
... but still I mean compared to Hangouts I mean, once I had finished recording
this video for you guys ... I'm gonna have to ...
I've got an integrated upload to YouTube thing in here you can see the
last one that I just uploaded.
The encoding process of turning whatever format
Screencast-O-Matic is saving the video in to
what it needs to be to be displayed on YouTube can sometimes take a long time
that's sometimes a big issue for me in terms of managing my day
so doing a Hangout stream is fantastic in that like I've done the stream
that's it. I don't have to ... I can just "Fire-and-forget" and
it's up there ... but there's other issues we'll go into a minute. So Screencast-O-Matic
I happen to use that ...
there are lots of other ones, there are lots of other platform-specifics that work
only on OSX, or Linux or Windows and then there's other online meeting tools which I've had
some experience with and I just ... I think
the Google hangouts is so ...
the fact that it's free and it's by Google and it works pretty
well ...
I guess one key thing, if we go on to Screencast-O-Matic
which is as I say there's a
a 15-minute limit. I actually hadn't noticed the watermark but
that was certainly ScreenFlow's (business) model ...
there are actually editing tools built into the pro version
... you can upload directly ...
to YouTube. I think the particular thing that I like
about ... for recording these ... I mean I could be recording these little lecture segments
on the Hangouts but
you kind of have to go either showing the entire screen or showing the person's
face
and backwards and forwards and I would much rather have ... and
I think my students suggest they prefer ... I don't know
the little picture in picture talking head
which is ... we've got to be careful with the placement of that because of ...
it might obscure a different part of the screen which might be important
but you can move that around afterwards ... yeah and it's multi-platform, so
for my students ... I mean I think now I'm recommending
all my HPU students, and I'll be recommending all the MOOC students for ...
documenting their ... or your, shall we say, documenting
their work ... to be using the hangouts because it's just
so much less time but if you're not connected to the network; if
you've got a very spotty network connection ... for some reason you can't use a Hangout
and you need to record a little simple video
the free version of Screencast-O-Matic is absolutely fine ...
yeah so ... Mac options there's a series of things. Actually this is getting easier and
easier;
and the QuickTime screencasts; FaceTime ... there's a number a free
options ... I think you can also, you can
pay for the version of iMovie. I've used iMovie to edit
some things in the past ... there are converters ... I think the file format
is becoming less of an issue. It still seems to take a long ... I mean
just the nature of the beast is that it takes a long time to convert from one file
format
to another. From my point of view, anything that instantly gets it onto YouTube and I don't
have to think about the conversion
has got to be good ... there are a number of open source clients
for Windows, I think there are a number of paid clients as well. I may have used
CamStudio in the past ... generally I have had
a fair amount of problem ...
with Windows ... particularly for a game programming course where I was
... desperate to try and record both the audio from the games
and me talking about the games as I played them and gave feedback for my
students
on the games that they'd designed. I think that might of actually been the reason that I switched to
Screencast-O-Matic because Screenflow was specific to
the Mac and I needed to get it working on Windows
for the ... many of the games were Windows only ...
yeah ... that said I have had trouble
in the past, this is another thing, on Mac with recording this
the audio stream for both Screencast-O-Matic, sorry from both the
... my audio, my spoken audio and the
audio that's coming out of the computer. That seems to be becoming less
of a problem. I guess I'm using ... Hangouts now so frequently
.... I did have a sort of a big set up anyway, that's sort of Mac-specific and probably
won't worry many of you but if anybody wants to chat
about ... I mean I've been teaching exclusively online for about four years now;
is it coming up to five? And so anybody who wants to wax lyrical with me about different
recording options
I'd be happy to chat. I have much less experience with Linux.
I tend to record on Windows and OSX. I tend not to record
... in Linux ...
my good friends tell me that there are ...
yeah ... ffmpeg, which I think I also had a Windows version for but that ...
ffmpeg is recommended. There are also some other ones
... as I say, I don't try and do ... I don't have so much
experience recording in that environment and then there's a lot of these
different
online meeting systems like WebEx and GoToMeeting and TeamViewer
and so on that I think some people swear by. I guess
I'm always worried with ... I guess with any software
framework you're sort of worried about
... you're going to end up paying monthly fees and is the company going to go out of business
and so on; and one feels
if Google have got a free offering, I tend to go there
... but yeah if people are having particularly good experiences
with these do let me know ... well I've had some
bad experiences in the past although of course
... it's very impressive how so many companies
up their game over time and the software improves over time
so ... yeah I just ... we'll finish up there with saying
record your live sessions ... I think it's really valuable
... and there's lots of different ways to do it and
and give it a try, okay, bye for now!
