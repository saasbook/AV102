Hello! Welcome to week four! Here we are!

It's week four already! 

So this week we're talking about communications and breakdowns.

[NEXT SLIDE]

So the techniques that we are going to be talking about this week are, as they have been throughout the course,

just as valuable for centralised as they are for distributed settings.

But they are, as usual, particularly valuable in
distributed settings.

The process of managing bugs and
communication issues is part of every human team activity related to software

But you might argue this applies to almost any team activity at all;

say you're launching a new marketing plan, you're
starting a new business.

The process of problems coming up and then communicating effectively to solve them ... 

It's a really common pattern that needs to be managed whether you are in a centralized or a distributed setting

So I think the same ideas will serve you well
for being TAs, for being involved in 
AgileVentures; for any kind of software related team activity.

Or indeed may I be so bold as to say
*any* team activity; 

but so what have we got happening this week?  

[NEXT SLIDE]

First we're going to talk specifically about
communicating effectively in online forums.

I've been working hard to ensure every video in the course has subtitles and this week I've also managed to re-record some of the older ones.

Over the years we've iterated through a number of different online communication tools such as IRC, Slack, StackExchange, edX forums, Gitter, Slack ...

If there are still references to the older systems in this weeks videos, then my apologies.  

I'm working to replace all the videos, but it is time consuming, so apologies for any remaining out of date references.

However, the key thing is the basic principle of choosing the correct tool to communicate ...

ensuring you are considering the feelings of the person who's receiving your message; 

these ideas are consistent across any technology.

The important thing is to take your time getting used to the ins and out of each communication technology to get the best out of it.

Okay, so after that section on communicating effectively in online forums we're going to be talking about what bugs are and why they're inevitable. 

There's a nice section in the textbook on how to cope with bugs, which we'll ask you read as part of this week's assignments.  

We're also going to be looking at how to help create pairing events which is an important part of the MOOC and also about creating and recording live coding sessions
 
Finally I'll talk you through the edX Forum and wrap things up.

Just a quick note about the assignments this week.  

We're doing something new and experimental which is that as well as the usual pair programming session required for week 4, we're using edX's peer review feature.

What this means is that after you've recorded and submitted your pair programming session, you'll be asked to look at some other submitted videos to review how your peers have been doing pair programming.

This means that the deadline for this week's pair programming assignment is tighter than usual, as everyone needs to submit their assignments before the deadline so that everyone can start peer reviewing together in the following week.

This edX peer review technology somewhat experimental and so apologies in advance for any problems we encounter.

[NEXT SLIDE]

However we really appreciate you helping us test this as we are planning to roll out this kind of assignment in the MOOC.

The plan is to have students reviewing each others pairing sessions on a large scale.

We're making pair programming a requirement for participation in the official 169 part 3 project class which will be released later this year.

In the project class, students will be working in teams with a real non-profit or charity client to develop a product using agile principles.  

Part 3 is going to be a paid course in the first instance as we need to limit it to the most committed students who can work intensely over a short period to deliver a real product.

I think this is a really exciting development.  My initial motivation for creating AgileVentures itself was the absence of an online project component for the 169 Engineering Software as a Service course.

I was truly inspired with the way that Dave and Armando involve charities and non-profits in their live Berkeley class to allow students to experience agile development with a real customer.

It's trying to grapple with testing and prototyping and scrums and feature/bug/chore tracking while interacting with a real non-technical customer that is the crucible that forges really agile developers.

I hope all of you will get involved with this exciting new course whether taking enrolling directly or participating as TA project managers.

Anyhow, back to the current AV102 course; when you finish this week's assignments you'll be all
ready for your teaching assistant level 1
certificates, woohoo!

Alright let's get on with the week!
