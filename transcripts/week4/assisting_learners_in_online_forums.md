So let's 
just talk about generally ...

 
I've gone about let's try and make sure all 
the discussion happens in the groups ...

 
let's try and moderate ... adjust

 
the length of our more posts to whether
we're in IM or whether we are in

 
the Stack Exchange.  The key ...

 
let's be civil and polite. I do my best I mean
I

 
.. if I'm ever not civil and polite you can
like hold me back and say sam look

 
you said in this slide that we should
be civil and polite.  I think it's ...

 
I generally find this like ... often
we all get frustrated and angry with

 
the technology doesn't we want;
people don't seem to be behaving in the way we

 
want them to

 
... generally if we get angry and
frustrated and we let that boil over

 
into how we interact with people

 
we tend to find that those people are
going to be less helpful;

 
the people around us. If we're angry
they're gonna be less helpful. I guess

 
there's a kinda ...

 
I mean this is maybe cultural there's maybe in some

 
situations where unless  ... maybe in
some cultures maybe unless you are being really

 
angry

 
you won't get a response? I think that's ...

 
yeah, maybe that's just the
way it is and so maybe I have

 
to be accepting of

 
some people are going to be angry sometimes ...
and thats

 
culturally how they are? I guess I'm not a
big fan of anger; I hate people

 
being angry at me; I don't want to be angry at people;
so I'm a big fan of the

 
be civil and polite and I think often ...

 
I don't know I think the problem is when people start getting
angry it raises the temperature; it gets

 
difficult to think.

 
I think if we're all being civil and polite
then

 
its easier for everybody to think and we
can come to solutions more quickly?

 
Anyway so everybody ... we're all
learners; whether this is a

 
distributed team

 
or a MOOC or what have you, we're all hear to
learn; we're all

 
trying to ... this is life right?
Life is about learning we're trying to

 
become ... better
understand

 
how to make the most effective use the
resources around us;

 
so let's be patient with
each other; we're all trying to 

 
learn; we've all got something to offer

 
yes and if we can be patient and civil and polite
with each other we can discover what that is;

 
maybe ... so I mean I've already alluded to it;

 
distributed teams, this course, the world TA Course
AgileVentures

 
... span the globe; there are huge
cultural differences, language barriers, all sorts of

 
things.

 
Let's respect those and try ...
I like to think about the human

 
race

 
... the entire universe ... we're one!
We're one big team

 
although we may seem like we're going in
different directions at different times, we're
one big

 
team

 
and I think that to the extent
that we can honour and respect each other's

 
differences

 
and see past those to ... we're all
trying to

 
achieve wealth and bounty for all I
hope

 
then that's to all our benefit. So the 
key forum rules

 
really are

 
let's be patient, let's be respectful,
let's be civil and polite so let's

 
if people are ... if students
for example in the

 
in the MOOC are not respecting

 
those rules if members of your distributed
team are

 
not respecting each other then I think gently
but firmly

 
you want to remind people of say: "Hey that
you know could be

 
misinterpreted, let's be sensitive there." It's
difficult it's ... we sort of

 
say 

 
also moderate as little
as possible. I mean that's kinda of like a

 
judgement call;

 
in any situation with a team whether
its centralized or distributed

 
or it's online. I mean there's a particular
thing I think about online courses

 
online teams

 
where particularly text in emails

 
... someone is frustrated ... 
it can easily be taken out of

 
context. Things can get very heated

 
purely in email and we don't .. we try and avoid ...
actually for AgileVentures

 
and also the MOOC we try and avoid using email 
where possible ... but

 
similarly within

 
forums like StackExchange and so on, what
you thought of as a joke can

 
turn out to be something very offensive for
somebody else ... it's just ...

 
it's hard

 
and I think I have yet to work out a list

 
or a little metric or a
rule of thumb

 
that will magically allow you to not
offend everybody and so on

 
but so it's a kind of ... I think the
key thing is to be going into every

 
situation

 
calmly and if you're

 
suggesting to someone that they might
change their behavior for whatever

 
reason that you want to do that

 
in a way that tries to ... that starts off by
acknowledging their positive

 
contributions. You say:

 
"that's a fantastic response but I think
that that joke you made at the end might

 
be taken out ...

 
might be offensive for some
people and so on" and let's ...

 
the key really is keep talking ... if
there's issue let's

 
let's keep talking about it and hopefully we
can resolve it ...

 
so yeah I think I've kind of ...

 
I've kind of run ahead there. I mean to
the extent that we have

 
questions running in

 
ongoing discussions going in sort of 
threads like this then

 
you know if people are kinda like
veering crazily off topic

 
like: "Oh yes I had this completely different
issue that ... about something totally

 
unrelated

 
but let me ask" ... that is going to be
difficult for other people to find, like the title

 
of this

 
topic is not particularly relevant
anymore so we might want to say: "hey oh that's a

 
very important question, can we move that over into a
different

 
sub topic and so on" ... this is
one advice that comes down from edX

 
"End conversations that are no longer 
productive". I mean part of the

 
reason that I

 
am very keen on the chat
environment and bringing that in

 
is I think sometimes it's good
to just chat ... I mean you also need

 
to know

 
when to stop just chatting ... I guess
if people ...

 
if people are just busy arguing about
something and they're not listening to each

 
other and they're just being unpleasant

 
and that creates a negative vibe
then you want to kind of

 
say: "hey guys let's wrap this up or should
we you know what should we do?

 
Let's work out a way to finish it up." Yeah so
you want to get everyone to be civil.

 
If there are people
duplicating threads ... I mean they'll be a situation 

 
...

 
lots of people will be coming in who maybe haven't
used Stack Exchange before. They may

 
replicate additional questions in
here

 
so you might say "Oh this is a duplicate of
this question, let's move the

 
conversation over there!"

 
Perfectly reasonable thing to do ... and 
particularly point people by

 
saying "Oh you know before you ask a
question

 
do check using the search functionality
to see if

 
someone's already asked it, if the answers
already there and
do participate in the

 
existing topics rather than starting
new threads".

 
So I mean that's kinda like more general
I guess ...

 
station keeping ... when it comes to 
assisting learners and this might

 
be

 
another member of your distributed team I who
is

 
... got stock ... might be a

 
student that you're helping in a MOOC ... I mean
I guess for the ...

 
to the extent that it's a student who's
really focusing their time on

 
on being a learner ... you kind of want
to help them without revealing an answer;

 
offer scaffolding and
allow the ... we've talked about education scaffolding

 
before which is not revealing the answer
and basically allowing students to solve their
own problem.

 
In a distributed team that might be different in
that you if your goal is just ...

 
to get something done as quickly as
possible,

 
you might ... with your distributed team you just want
to tell the person that this is

 
the solution

 
... I guess that's maybe the key difference
between the

 
people who are coming and saying "right, I really want to
learn here", although

 
that has a place as well in
distributed teams in that ...

 
what you kind of want to do is
not have a situation where

 
other team members are just dependent on you
for answering questions all the time

 
... what you wanna do is try and help all of
your team members

 
build independence ... generally

 
one of the reasons that we're 
trying train as many

 
TAs as possible is to provide timely
answers in the forums ... if

 
you can

 
get in there and give an
fantastic and that's

 
a general rule I think with a distributed team
as well, the quicker that you

 
can get feedback

 
the happier people generally are;
although of course

 
we can't be perfect and
then I think as regards

 
to students ... if they're just
asking for

 
general things about I don't understand
what git is? I mean you

 
can help explain that but you can also
say "hey you know, why not

 
do a search for git textbook or
here's a relevant

 
links to be looking at and so on", but the
key thing generally is

 
I guess if they've got a course
specific question

 
then ideally you help students

 
as a TA in the forums, in the chat, in the hangouts,
instead of saying

 
online search ... I mean ... there's
this issue that as we know the

 
homework answers

 
are kind of out there ... it's

 
... the whole reason to
put the course in place is to help people

 
learn

 
actually if you're just looking up the
answers online you're not ... you're kind

 
of undercutting your own learning ...
so I think we wanna

 
generally be clear about how ... 
that we shouldn't be sharing

 
answers with each other. It's all about this we
want to help each other learn. We want to

 
scaffold each other rather than just

 
allow people to copy answers 

 
verbatim ... if you're in a
position to answer a question do

 
answer it

 
... general points ...

 
make sure that your information
is correct. If you are unsure about

 
your information do check with others

 
first; particularly as regards the
upcoming course

 
then do complete
assignments in a week in advance and

 
you will know what's going on ... similarly 
with distributed teams

 
sometimes if you're too hasty
in jumping in offering

 
advice when it may be the wrong one that can 
undermine the team activity

 
and particularly from the course side of
things encourage

 
learning and reading and also particularly
pairing ... I'm a big big fan of 

 
pairing; we'll talk more about that
later in the lecture sequence this week.

 
So here's kind of like a set of

 
little guidelines from ... we've 

 
pulled together from the ... our experiences in
in the MOOC

 
so far which I think

 
also refers to managing
communication with distributed teams;

 
thats sometimes there's going to be language
barriers; so

 
sometimes you'll need say, right, I
wanna rephrase it

 
I'm gonna try and use examples ... there's
courseware issues

 
... so there's gonna be for
any given

 
assignment there's gonna be common
problems

 
... I'll try and give your a prep
on those week by week as we go through

 
... if you can do the

 
homework assignments in advance that would be
very helpful ...

 
sometimes students will come in saying ...
I mean as you can imagine this is
customers coming into a distributed 

 
team and saying: "look, well we've tried to
install your software on this other

 
unsupported OS or IDE" and
the situation there is to be polite and say

 
"yes we're focusing on
supporting

 
these platforms with the VM and so on" and
so

 
sure if you can help them solve
that issue ... but prioritise people

 
who are having issues with the courseware 
and recommend to people doing

 
alternate stuff that they should use the courseware

 
because that is trying to make our
own ability to manage everybody's

 
issues ... manage them more effectively

 
... if you don't know the answer .. come and talk

 
and we'll work it out ...
this is one of the great

 
opportunities is a student may
be exploring some aspect of some

 
issue that you hadn't got in to when you

 
did the course previously so this is an opportunity
for your own learning

 
... if the students gone of out into
the blue

 
if they're off doing their "yak shaving activity" ...

 
you wanna say: "you seem to be getting
right off track and

 
let's see if we can get you back to the
right place"

 
... and then also there's ... as you're aware
we have the auto graders which

 
will grade

 
student homeworks ... and

 
sometimes students will say, oh it's the autograder 
that's not working ... often it's actually some sort of

 
homework issue

 
... or I mean I'd certainly say that we've got
issues with the

 
auto graders and sometimes the error messages they
give are difficult to interpret 

 
that's something

 
we're trying to fix but ... if it
does seem that the auto graders are down

 
then the key thing is to let
me know as soon as possible and do that

 
through

 
Skype chat ... so

 
finally we've got 
helping students solve problems efficiently

 
... there's going to be times ...
when they've installed ...

 
they have installation issues so look
out for ...

 
skipped or incomplete steps ... if they
haven't mastered the directions and this is the

 
kind of situation sometimes where it can take a
long time in chat to work out what's

 
going on but if you're in a
hangout

 
and they show you oh well I did this and I did
this and they can show you the history of their

 
activity on the UNIX command line
you can see oh yes you didn't do this

 
this one thing or that thing and

 
if they have ... their homework
is failing ... look

 
out for the student including features
that weren't required

 
that they're touching the wrong
bits of the code ... they're having

 
trouble

 
interpreting the exception error messages
... and actually you say ... I 

 
say this

 
I think this comes up in distributed teams 
all the time ... working with

 
... the client has done a spec and the
developer working on

 
the code says: "oh yes we could use
this and we could use this" and

 
so this is the skills of the TA

 
not so different from that of a project manager of 
a distributed team

 
you need to be helping your developers
focus on

 
exactly the parts of the code they need to
focusing one so ...

 
you're getting a real value for
money, as it were, putting your time as a TA

 
I think it really does ... I'm constantly.
agonizing about: "oh no we're doing too many things with this course we're teaching you about
distributed teams, we're teaching you about being a TA

 
I think there is a lot of overlap; but
yeah so that's communicating effectively inonline
forums

 
... I hope that's helpful and I look
forward to communicating with all of you in the online forums as the course goes forward.
Alright, bye for now.
