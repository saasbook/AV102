Right, so let's talk about communicating effectively in online forums, of which there are many kinds. 

[NEXT SLIDE]

The term "Online Forum" tends to make us think of "bulletin boards" and similar systems with threaded conversations, although the term can be used to refer to pretty much anything that is not video conferencing.

If we think of things in terms of that scale we were looking at last week, an online forum is anything that doesn't involve real time audio or video and instead relies on text and possibly embedded images and video.

So that's what we mean by online forums and they are, I think, extraordinarily valuable for online students and for distributed teams ...

because very often you can't get together at the same time, or just bandwidth limitations prevent you from doing realtime audio or visual interaction.

So basically, whether you're studying online or you're taking part in a distributed team, the problems are often similar. 

You're faced with some challenge, some technology problem, or maybe it's a team organisation problem, that you need advice on, and so these forums can help you solve your problem.

The forum, might have been created specifically for your group by your team, or have been created as a resource for students, or just been created by other people related to a particular technology.  

Either way, online forums are a great resource to help you solve all sorts of problems, as I'm sure you well know.

They also allow a bit of human contact which is a good thing.

Maybe there are some people who really don't want to interact with other people and just work in isolation.

We did have at least one person who responded to the pair programming questionnaire a couple of years ago saying "I just don't like people!"  

So yes, right, if you really don't like interacting with people in real time, then scrums and pair-programming are definitely out for you. 

But perhaps the interaction of an online text forum is more manageable for some.
 
Although perhaps in extreme cases even just forum interaction might make some uncomfortable?

However I would argue that almost all problem-solving, particularly that related to technology, critically requires contact with other members of your team.

Also, if you're a learner I think contact with other learners is hugely hugely valuable.

I think learners can often feel that they are suffering alone, stuck at the bottom of a well, feeling that they are the only person who doesn't understand a particular problem and that everybody else is finding it very easy.

I believe that if you make the right sort of contact with other learners you can very often discover that you're having the same problem that a lot of other people are having and you can share your frustration about that and perhaps work out a solution together.
 
Forums are also a great avenue to getting help from course staff such as a TA. 

Recent developments in online forums have moved towards more question and answer based approaches, like Quora or StackOverflow, so you get these big repositories of common questions collected together. 

The answers to common questions can then be collected and voted upon and through a process of community action the most valuable answers can rise to the top. 

There's also whole communities related to particular technologies such as Linux or Ruby on Rails or whatever, that can be very very powerful engines for generating solutions.

Now we're going to make a distinction, which you may have heard of before, between asynchronous and synchronous forums.

Asynchronous forums are these "message boards" where content is organised around posts, often in a question/answer format, e.g. Google Groups, Quora and StackOveflow 

Synchronous forums are also called chat, Instant Messengers, or IM for short, and they offer what I would call real time text communication. 

You can't usually see the actual act of someone else typing letter by letter ...

but most recent chat systems have an indication that another person is in the process of typing, before you see their chat message.

This appears to be designed to help prevent people "chatting over each other" and keep the conversation going.
 
The key thing however is that the text update, when it comes, is pushed up in a compact format, and you don't have to refresh a web browser, or make an active request in order to see the new message.

[NEXT SLIDE]

Of course the border line between these synchronous and asynchronous forums blurs with things like GitHub issues and pull requests, where GitHub uses Websockets to push live updates to the conversation.

That can be really handy, but the Github commenting format still looks like an asynchronous forum, and "chat" clients tend to be much more compact, to allow for a faster back and forth.

Some people are not so keen on text chat interactions, but it's becoming more and more prevalent as more and more people are using text chat on cellphones, in websites, through apps like whatsapp, and software like Slack, which is replacing email internally in some organisations. 

[NEXT SLIDE]

But so let's compare the edX forum with the Slack or Gitter chats that we also use in the course.

Here's the edX Forum with its list of topics and a single question picked out.

In principle if you are refreshing the page fast enough in an asynchronous forum like edX or StackOverflow then you can get an experience almost like a real-time chat, but that's rare.

[NEXT SLIDE]

Real time "synchronous" chats like Gitter or Slack

[NEXT SLIDE]

increase the chances that a real-time chat conversation will take place.

I'm sure some people are thinking: "but, why do we have all these different alternatives? Why are we
having both the embedded gitter chat and the edX forum?""

My answer is that they are different tools that have different values at different times.

Sometimes when you're trying to quickly solve a problem with somebody and they tell you something and you want to ask
them a little question ...

if they can respond quickly you can get a productive back and forth.

Sometimes you can cut through a lot of red tape if you're just both typing into a real time chat.

It's a double edged sword of course, because things can also get a lot more intense, and you have to be careful you're not overwhelming the other person.

There's also visibility, so a shared chat room can allow a lot of people to quickly contribute to a discussion, but again that be good or bad depending on the circumstances.

Another factor is that real time chat systems don't tend to support discussion threads in the same way that asynchronous forums do rather well.

I'm getting ahead of myself here though ... let's list the different pros and cons to the different systems.

[NEXT SLIDE?]

So returning to this asynchronous/synchronous distinction;

"Asynchronous" implies that people are going to be looking at the forum at different times; 

the forum it not designed specifically for users being online together, which means posts to the forum are coming in one after another with short breaks, in a "serial" fashion.

"Synchronous" imples "real time", that the various parties are at the computer interacting in real time, contributing in "Parallel". 

Although, what I would point out for things like Slack and Gitter is that one can slide backwards and forwards between a synchronous and an asynchronous conversation.

Particularly if you've got a relatively inactive chat channel, you can leave a post in there and someone might not see it for an hour and then they would respond and then you might have an asynchronous discussion in the "real-time" chat over the course of a day or two.

Then suddenly you're online together and it becomes synchronous.

Anyway I think the ability to slide backwards and forwards between those two states is potentially a very valuable aspect of a text chat.

Asynchronous systems tend to have better persistence, with many chat systems having a limited history or visibility as regards previous chat messsages.

Asynchronous forums likely encourage a broader participation, with it being easier to branch off into a different thread.

Whereas it's more complicated to refer back to older chats in synchronous forums, in some cases limiting the interaction to the currently active participants.

Probably one of the key things to consider is the length of your post to different forums.

In general the greater the length of the thing you post the fewer people who are going to have time to read it.

Now you might have a lot to say, and if you need to rant and brain-dump, then that's fine.

However in general I would say longer posts should go into asynchronous forums where people will have more time to review them.

Even then you will do yourself a huge favour in terms of getting your message across if you edit your post to be as short as possible.

In real-time chat you should prefer to make your posts as short as you can, almost as if you were speaking to somebody.

You know that glazed look that people can get if you speak for too long?  People will just switch off, and potentially get irritated, so its important to keep your real-time chat posts short and to the point.

If you have eight questions, that's great, write them all down somewhere safe, and then post just the most important one.

Then ask the other questions as the opportunities arise, rather than posting a whole wall of text into the chat.

Some people might say: "well you know, I've got a lot to say. I need to be able to say it all." 

Well ultimately it's your choice, but my recommendation is that you think carefully about the impact your posts have on other people.

Lots of people are very busy ...

Many of us have got a lot of commitments, such as work, family (kids or elderly relatives) making ends meet and so on.

You might say, "I don't have time to edit down all my thoughts", which may be true, but if so you're pushing the editing work onto others.  

Others might not have time to both edit your thoughts and then also respond to them.

If the complex thought you are having really requires saying a lot of things then that's also a good time to consider posting to an asynchronous forum where you're putting less pressure on others to read what you say.  

If you're worried that you haven't received a reply on your asynchronous forum submission, then post a link to it into the real time chat.

I think that's a very powerful combination.  Bringing up an issue in text chat, but adding a link to more details for those who are interested.

If it's really really long, even for a forum post, then how about writing a blog post? 

Then you can post the link to the blog to any of the forums, chat, bulletin boards or what have you. 

There's also the question of back and forth.

Text chat is set up to allow a quick back and forth, but even with short posts you can end up overwhelming someone if you persist in a line of questioning or debate past a certain point.

I've got more to say about this, but perhaps I'll follow my own advice and direct you to a blog post I wrote on the subject :-)

[HIGHLIGHT LINK TO BLOG]

Coming back to the slide; it will depends on who's around but you can get a much faster response in a chat environment.

What I would really strongly recommend is asking questions in group channels rather than to individuals.

I get a lot of people contacting me individually with questions like "oh what do you think of this new technology, or this new course", which I'd really much rather respond to in a group chat, rather than a direct message or DM.

It's partly that with hundreds of TAs and thousands of students it's hard for me to respond individually.

Also, if you're DMing me then you have to wait until I am free to answer your question. 

If you ask in a group chat or forum, then potentially you get an answer faster, because someone else can respond before me.

Please don't ever ask "can I ask you a question?" 

That just guarantees that it will take longer to get your answer. 

I will always say, "yes, you can ask me a question."  

However I do really prefer that if it's not a life and death personal matter that you ask in a group channel or forum because 1. you'll get an answer faster, and 2. others may benefit from seeing the conversation.

I get the sense that many people are embarressed to ask questions in group channels.

They don't want to bother other people, or they don't want to look like they don't know something.

I strongly believe that one of the most important things in learning is to be able to admit in front of others that you don't know something.

It is okay not to know things, or to be unsure; and it's by having a conversation in a group where we all admit to not knowing things that we can become a powerful learning team.

When answers then gets shared with multiple people, this is part of succeeding as a distributed team.

Another distinguishing feature is that historically it's generally been the case that asynchronous forums are not so easily searchable.

However Slack has gone a long way to change this by providing good search functionality in their chat client. 

So maybe asynchronous forums are better when you need to describe a longer more complex problem and synchronous forums are better for clarification and simple guidance?

Both kinds of forums can be very powerful support for problem solving, but both should be used carefully.

Clumsy use of either can sometimes draw out an issue which might be more quickly resolved in a real time hangout with screen share; or perhaps just have been better left alone or solved individually.

My rule of thumb is struggle by yourself for 20 minutes - and then if you're making no progress at all it's time to look for help.

So then are you looking for support in chat?  In a Q&A forum or in a real time hangout?

One disadvantage to the community of real time A/V interaction is that the history of it is not text searchable in the same way as chats and posts.

But sometimes an interactive video where a person is saying: "Oh I'm clicking here and I'm doing this" ...

And then we're like "Oh of course, the thing we've been talking about for the last few hours" in a real time chat or asynchronous forum suddenly becomes transparent

So in summary all of these different tools have a valuable role to play, and the trick is to learn when to use which.

Where we want to be is a place in which we are choosing the best tool for the job, i.e. is this a problem for an asynchronous forum, or a real time chat, or for a live audio/visual stream like a Google hangout.

[NEXT SLIDE] 

So there's lots of free chat options if you're setting up your own distributed team

In the past we went with a combination of Skype and IRC.

However in AgileVentures we've now switched completely to Slack, and in edX we've switched to Gitter;

We're using the free tiers of these systems, which require payment to unlock more resources, such as history, or number of team members.

The key thing here is the way in which the user interfaces of systems like Slack and Gitter are starting to outpace what's on offer from other free and open source solutions.
 
We use Gitter in the MOOC specifically because it is embeddable and thus easily discoverable by students without having to go through an invite process.

So in summary I'd strongly recommend you experiment with the free tiers of systems like Slack and Gitter, which also provide lots of great integrations with code versioning and continuous integration systems so your team can keep up to date with your code and its deployment.

If you ask me in the AgileVentures slack chat I'll be happy to show you some examples.
