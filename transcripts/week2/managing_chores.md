So let's talk about managing chores. Now what are chores? ... now you may
... given that you've seen Pivotal Tracker and you're a bit familiar
with agile development ... you've got some idea about about chores
... the important thing really is to distinguish chores from user stories
they're things that ... need to be done
but they don't provide any direct obvious value to the customer. So typically
that's ...
essential jobs establishing frameworks or putting support in
that you know ultimately will you know support ... other stories
they're kind of just stuff that kinda has to be done
... though ultimately you know one wants as many chores as possible to be
automated
but that's the kind of ongoing thing of identifying you know where to put the
effort in about what to -
what to automate. I mean ... you know of course with the term chores makes it sound
like they might be basic menial
jobs but actually they can be very complex and
you know require as much skill and expertise as implementing
you know a complex - complex feature ... so
you will be at least partially familiar with Pivotal tracker as a result of having
done the 169 Engineering Software as a Service Course ... we'll be talking more about
you know that the bigger picture of Pivotal Tracker ...
next week but ... let's have a quick look ...
at some of the projects here from Agile Ventures ... these are all
open and public and you can go to them and see you know a real
a real project working there but so we can see how for example here in the current thing we've
got
... you know there was a a chore there to fix some broken domain name stuff there was a
domain name issue
... that that you know previously was working it broke
I mean it's you know of arguably the customer must have
the ... their their sites working in the in the right location
but the you know ... see you could sort of
there ... all the things you know it sort of ... as as long as your team
... is using a consistent ... metric for establishing that this is what's going to be a chore
and that's what's going to be a bug
we could have called that a bug rather than a chore ...
but often if we have a look at some of the other different bits and pieces ... now will that not go
away
go on ... if we go back here
we can see that for example you know adding code climate integration
... into into the system you know in order to check ...
the sort of code metrics automatically against pull requests ... that's something that the
you know that you know the customer is not going to ask for but is going to be useful
for the development team and we'd like to have ... going on ...
so that's that's a good example of a chore ...
the interesting thing is the impact of chores ... they kind of have a
a negative effect on the business value on the business value output
and they're reducing velocity ... they're not usually assigned points
they're things that have got to be done and you might be tempted,
and people very often are, to say well
you know this is gonna take you know what? one or two
points ... to sort of you want to estimate
how long they're going to take ... but
Pivotal and others strongly recommend against doing that
it's sort of, they just sort of, that's part of the cost of being in business
and so you know the time that it takes to get those chores done along with the
... the features is kind of, ends up you know helping with the
the velocity calculation but ... more on that
... when we come to it next next week
... yeah that they ... they can also represent you know code debt that some
refactoring
... needs to be done you know and points to a dependency on other teams
... you don't necessarily know in advance what your chores are going to be they just sort of come up
each week and ... but sort of keeping you know it's very important to keep track of
all these things that need to be done as well as the things that ... you know these
users stories that have real business value
and ... get to a certain extent you know the
automatic velocity calculation can free you up from having to worry about
you know exactly how much ... they they
they take up in terms of ... resources, time spent
um so they can you know they can be high priority
... it can be that a critical chore you know a bit of infrastructure has to be done all
to support
some of the, some other story maybe multiple stories
maybe multiple teams even ... so you know coordinating getting these done
... is is is important ... and it's said
you know that's where you know in systems like tracker where you can you know
reorder
things and put things into one sprint or another ...
is ... is very very useful but ... the key thing here
really for you know individuals
centralized teams, distributed teams, is you know remembering that these things need to be done
... kind of distinguishing y'know in your mind from the
the high-level users stories that that really drive business value
and you know choosing out ... those things that need to be
chores, but that's something again, I think, you know ... continually using
systems like Pivotal where all the while you're doing is being
broken into ... you know high-level user stories,
chores, bugs, ... and so forth is is definitely the way to go.
We don't make as much use I think as we should ... of
releases ... partly you know this is, these are an open source project
non-profit organisations are slightly ... slower-paced
... but yes, understanding chores very important
