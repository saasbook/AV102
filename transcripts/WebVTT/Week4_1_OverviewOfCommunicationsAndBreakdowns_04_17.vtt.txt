00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.250
Hello! Welcome to week four! Here we are!

1
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.840
It's week four already!

2
00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.269
So this week we're talking about communications and breakdowns.

3
00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.659
So the techniques that we are going to be talking about this week are, as they have

4
00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:15.339
been throughout the course,

5
00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.170
just as valuable for centralized as they are for distributed settings.

6
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.520
But they are, as usual, particularly valuable in

7
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.300
distributed settings.

8
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.810
The process of managing bugs and communication issues is part of every human

9
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.390
team activity related to software

10
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.630
But you might argue this applies to almost any team activity at all;

11
00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.800
say you're launching a new marketing plan, you're

12
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.750
starting a new business.

13
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
The process of problems coming up and then communicating effectively to solve them ...

14
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.150
It's a really common pattern that needs to be managed whether you are in a centralized

15
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:45.510
or a distributed setting.

16
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.829
So I think the same ideas will serve you well for being TA's, for being involved in

17
00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.110
AgileVentures; for any kind of software related team activity.

18
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.000
Or indeed may I be so bold as to say *any* team activity;

19
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.670
but so what have we got happening this week?

20
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.080
First we're going to talk specifically about communicating effectively in online forums.

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.470
I've been working hard to ensure every video in the course has subtitles and this week

22
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.330
I've also managed to re-record some of the older ones.

23
00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.530
Over the years we've iterated through a number of different online communication tools such

24
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.500
as IRC, Slack, StackExchange, edX forums, Gitter, Slack ...

25
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.600
If there are still references to the older systems in this week's videos, then my apologies.

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.100
I'm working to replace all the videos, but it is time consuming, so apologies for any

27
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.650
remaining out of date references.

28
00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.910
However, the key thing is the basic principle of choosing the correct tool to communicate

29
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:36.710
...

30
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.030
ensuring you are considering the feelings of the person who's receiving your message;

31
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.119
these ideas are consistent across any technology.

32
00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.119
The important thing is to take your time getting used to the ins and out of each communication

33
00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.119
technology to get the best out of it.

34
00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.040
Okay, so after that section on communicating effectively in online forums we're going to

35
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.860
be talking about what bugs are and why they're inevitable.

36
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.900
There's a nice section in the textbook on how to cope with bugs, which we'll ask you

37
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.909
to read as part of this week's assignments.

38
00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.040
We're also going to be looking at how to help create pairing events which is an important

39
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.450
part of the MOOC and also about creating and recording live coding sessions

40
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.760
Finally I'll talk you through the edX Forum and wrap things up.

41
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.459
Just a quick note about the assignments this week.

42
00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.370
We're doing something new and experimental which is that as well as the usual pair programming

43
00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.380
session required for week 4, we're using edX's peer review feature.

44
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.760
What this means is that after you've recorded and submitted your pair programming session,

45
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.480
you'll be asked to look at some other submitted videos to review how your peers have been

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.599
doing pair programming.

47
00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.629
This means that the deadline for this week's pair programming assignment is tighter than

48
00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.830
usual, as everyone needs to submit their assignments before the deadline so that everyone can start

49
00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.879
peer reviewing together in the following week.

50
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.400
This edX peer review technology somewhat experimental and so apologies in advance for any problems that

51
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.120
we encounter.

52
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.760
However we really appreciate you helping us test this as we are planning to roll out this

53
00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.819
kind of assignment in the MOOC.

54
00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.800
The plan is to have students reviewing each other's pairing sessions on a large scale.

55
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.430
We're making pair programming a requirement for participation in the official 169 part

56
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.849
3 project class which will be released later this year.

57
00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:15.030
In the project class, students will be working in teams with a real non-profit or charity

58
00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.310
client to develop a product using agile principles.

59
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.830
Part 3 is going to be a paid course in the first instance as we need to limit it to the

60
00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.480
most committed students who can work intensely over a short period to deliver a real product.

61
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.849
I think this is a really exciting development. My initial motivation for creating AgileVentures

62
00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.879
itself was the absence of an online project component for the 169 Engineering Software

63
00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.300
as a Service course.

64
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.810
I was truly inspired with the way that Dave and Armando involve charities and non-profits

65
00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.879
in their live Berkeley class to allow students to experience agile development with a real

66
00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.239
customer.

67
00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.379
It's trying to grapple with testing and prototyping and scrums and feature/bug/chore tracking

68
00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.069
while interacting with a real non-technical customer that is the crucible that forges

69
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.290
really agile developers.

70
00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.739
I hope all of you will get involved with this exciting new course whether taking - enrolling

71
00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.870
directly or participating as TA project managers.

72
00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:10.239
Anyhow, back to the current AV102 course; when you finish this week's assignments you'll

73
00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.549
be all ready for your teaching assistant level 1

74
00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:13.530
certificates, woohoo!

75
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.650
Alright let's get on with the week!
