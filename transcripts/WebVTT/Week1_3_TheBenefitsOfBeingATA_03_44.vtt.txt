00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.899
So what are the benefits of being a TA?

1
00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.450
There's certainly a lot of work that can be put into being a TA, but what are the benefits?

2
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.260
Some of them would be boosting your own skills.

3
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.930
There's a whole range of skills that you would develop as a TA.

4
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.949
One is your coding skills, since the process of explaining how to code to other people

5
00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.779
solidifies your own understanding of that coding process.

6
00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:24.849
There's the collaboration component.

7
00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.119
There is this idea that coding is all about doing things individually; staying up all

8
00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.119
night, drinking lots of coffee.

9
00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.019
Actually I would argue, as many others do, that it's a lot more about collaboration;

10
00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:38.890
being able to communicate effectively with others is absolutely essential.

11
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.390
And again being a TA is all about collaboration and so your collaboration skills will improve.

12
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.920
There's using all the online tools.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.370
We might take these for granted to an extent but practice with different kinds of online

14
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.300
chat and asynchronous forums and all the hangout stuff from Google; screen share etc.

15
00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.870
will improve your online tech skills.

16
00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.859
As you know you're working with a team of TA's and students which can help develop your

17
00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.580
team skills.

18
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.750
And of course all the things from the course such as Software Engineering, Agile development

19
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:09.890
and so on.

20
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.400
Particularly to the extent that you get involved in projects with students and the Agile Ventures

21
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.020
projects that we have going on in the background

22
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.890
There's also the conflict resolution skills you'll develop - are developing - when students are getting

23
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.520
at each others throats, or even other TA's getting at each others throats :-)

24
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.680
Helping to resolve those conflicts is something you can put on your resume.

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.530
There's the experience of working with remote developers from all around the world. We're

26
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.300
overwhelmed by all the different nationalities and spoken languages that we have represented

27
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.060
in our community.

28
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.640
It really is a fantastic environment in which to show how you can collaborate with an international

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.610
distributed team.

30
00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.660
So there's all that benefit in potentially boosting your skills.

31
00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.410
And not only that, we've got certificates too!

32
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.020
These are the official Engineering Software-as-a-Service textbook certificates, which

33
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.700
are also backed by AgileVentures.

34
00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.750
We've got an example of the level 1 certificates there so you'll get one of these for completing

35
00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.240
this course.

36
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.780
You'll get the level 2 certificate if you participate as a TA in the 169.1 course and

37
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.500
perform a sufficient level of student supporting activity every week over the seven or so weeks

38
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.920
of that course, or equivalent work on an AgileVentures project.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.620
And if you do the same thing again in the 169.2 course then you can get a level 3 certificate

40
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.310
and these are all things that go into your portfolio.

41
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.950
Having a portfolio, a collection of your projects and achievements is important for your future

42
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.860
job and university applications.

43
00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:39.410
You'll be able to add to your portfolio that you've been a teaching assistant for the 169

44
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.810
Engineering Software as a Service course; that you've completed this Distributed Teams

45
00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.460
course and gained these certificates.

46
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.460
There's also the Agile Ventures projects that you work on as part of this which could also

47
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.460
go into your portfolio, since as you know Agile Ventures is a project incubator for

48
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.400
open source projects.

49
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.420
The big thing really is about giving back to the community.

50
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.520
It's been fantastic the last few years as many leading universities have made lots of

51
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.040
their learning materials and courses available for free.

52
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.160
I think pretty much everyone agrees this has made the world a better place.

53
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.540
So by giving back to the community you could help in the process of making this world one

54
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.930
in which education is available to everyone without hindrance.

55
00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.709
Also you can get really big personal satisfaction from helping other people

56
00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.170
Some people say that it's about becoming a star.

57
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.020
We're all stars you know, we're all radiating the light of human compassion.

58
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.730
It's that connection with people and helping other people that's makes things worthwhile

59
00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:35.319
really.

60
00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.780
So I'm looking forward to seeing you in the rest of the course and hopefully as TAs in

61
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.819
the MOOC or participants in Agile Ventures.
