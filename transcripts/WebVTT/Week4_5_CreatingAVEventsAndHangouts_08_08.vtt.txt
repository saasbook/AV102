Hey so I want to tell you about creating Hangouts and events on the AgileVentures site and I'm

1
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.950
recording all this with the QuickTime Player so that I can show you how the Hangouts work.

2
00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.860
So I think you're all familiar with Hangouts, Google Hangouts. Although Google is now re-branding

3
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.029
them to be called YouTube Live, and they're starting something called Meet, but anyway

4
00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.169
... many of you will have been in Hangouts this week ... but you might ask:

5
00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.249
"Why? If I'm doing some programming why do I want to be in a Hangout?"

6
00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:33.250
I think an interactive video is sometimes worth a billion words ... it's just ... in

7
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.970
a picture sometimes it illuminates things, sometimes that process of just being able

8
00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.100
to say to somebody:

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.850
"Look just this thing here or just well, it's this bit there!"

10
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.140
and have that coordinated discussion around something can really sort things out.

11
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.080
So I think it's great for problem solving and I really love Hangouts for pair programming.

12
00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.150
I know some people say:

13
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.350
"Oh well you know if you don't have control of each others computers like with

14
00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:55.710
Screen Hero or something it's not real pair programming!"

15
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.280
but actually I think if you're using GitHub Pong, which is actually my preferred mode

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.470
for pair programming remotely using a Hangout, then you get to practice your Git skills and

17
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.350
you get a Git record of what you've done.

18
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.810
I've now done hundreds of hours of pair programming with people all round the world through hangouts

19
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.030
and just ... I love it. Hangouts lets you see switch back and forth quickly between multiple

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.160
people's screens, which is really great for collaboration.

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.320
Also since it's just screen share you can use all kinds of other tools in combination

22
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.970
with the Hangout like C9, GitHub Pong and so on in order to share the code back and

23
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:26.970
forth.

24
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.170
The key thing I would say is that you really don't need a webcam. If you do and want to

25
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.171
share a video of your face that's great, but its the screenshare functionality of the Hangout

26
00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:38.440
that's really really valuable and so you can both be working on C9, or you could be working

27
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.940
in your own editor and doing GitHub Pong backwards and forwards and have a group of you.

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.890
I've done five-way GitHub Pong in different sessions before in Hangouts. The point is

29
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.920
that the hangouts themselves are so flexible and they allow you to stream and record video

30
00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.840
of the sessions to YouTube and it's just, I don't know it's great! Thank you Google

31
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.850
:-)

32
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.220
So there are various options to use Hangouts, but I'm just going to show you about

33
00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.420
how we can create Google Hangouts through the AgileVentures site.

34
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.049
We have an events feed and this is what we're going to be using to coordinate the pair programming

35
00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.520
for the MOOC.

36
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:21.260
So we've got AgileVentures there and we've got events there.

37
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.099
So you can see upcoming events and there's a button for create new event there that you

38
00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.140
can use if you want to create a pair programming event,

39
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:50.030
you can do that [BUTTON CLICK] - and pop it in there [BUTTON CLICK] - and that will create an event like these many events that

40
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.260
we have in the system and then these events have the ability to start a Hangout on Air

41
00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.720
and you may ask what's a Hangout on Air?

42
00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.020
That means it's recordable and it's also streamable so all of the Hangouts that we do for our

43
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.260
AgileVenture Scrums or stand-ups and so on, they are all run through the AgileVentures

44
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:12.620
site.

45
00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.580
What I would do here for example is there's the next Scrum coming up in a couple of hours.

46
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:40.260
The way I was creating all of those Hangouts for the stand-ups and so on was by

47
00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.120
using this button here "Start a Hangout on Air"

48
00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.140
and by using these AgileVentures events and Hangout integration we can work out when to

49
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.200
meet and notify people of the Scrum hangout link in Slack.

50
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.319
If we create an event as a pair programming session as I was just doing here then it appears

51
00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:04.920
in the events list but it doesn't appear with the timer and the counter on our home page

52
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.920
and in the popup.

53
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.830
Those are specifically for scrums or stand-ups.

54
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.570
So the big change we've had is that Google has retired the Hangout API, which means that

55
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.220
our events no longer ping Slack or Gitter automatically, so if you want that to happen

56
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.760
so that others can enter your Hangout, you'll have to take the Hangout URL from the address

57
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.220
bar and update the event manually.

58
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.320
It's a real pain and I'm sure lots of people will forget or find it hard, but at the moment

59
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.260
we don't have a replacement for Google Hangout plugins. Hopefully soon, but if we create

60
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.900
a pair programming event that starts in a minute or two and start the hangout like so:

61
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:43.380
So if we start that we'll see the URL.

62
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.610
Of course we have to click through the disclaimer about being recorded which some people get

63
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.610
kind of freaked out about.

64
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.490
Personally I've been recording my life and posting it online

65
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.560
for much of the last three or four years and I don't seem to have had any problems yet,

66
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.410
but it's not for everybody.

67
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:19.400
And then grab the URL from the address bar and go back into the event

68
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:32.380
and open "Event Actions" like so and click "Edit Hangout link" and paste the URL in like

69
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:40.270
so, and then "Save" it, then we should see the event go live on the site, and now other

70
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.230
people can click here to access the Hangout and we should see a notification in Slack

71
00:05:44.230 --> 00:06:12.139
where we've got a pairing notifications channel so you can see here that we've got pair programming

72
00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.590
going on different projects and so on and so on.

73
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.332
So in principle you can just get access to the Hangouts there, but, and this is the other

74
00:06:19.332 --> 00:06:22.270
reason I absolutely love Google Hangouts is that you start to hang out and you get the

75
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:36.522
link and then you can paste it in into an email or into another chat room and you have

76
00:06:36.522 --> 00:06:40.050
a simple mechanism for getting people into the same room that doesn't involve inviting

77
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.509
them and waiting for other automated systems to kick in.

78
00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:47.020
I'm also a huge fan of Hangouts on Air.

79
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.410
I really insisted on that in the AgileVentures site, that all of the Hangouts created should

80
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.410
be recordable.

81
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.470
Not automatically recorded! Just that they are at least recordable, as I think it's so

82
00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:57.950
useful to be able to keep a record of what you did in the Hangout.

83
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:02.759
You have to press the record button to actually record.

84
00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.960
Note that one of the things we have here is that the event host, which in principle can

85
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.180
be anybody with a YouTube linked account can start this hangout on air ...

86
00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.460
so if you're doing a stand-up or a Scrum, it's sensible that the event host would do it but

87
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.180
in principle for pairing sessions ...

88
00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.620
maybe one person who gets there first - or it's a group of you or what have you whoever gets there

89
00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.259
first - can make the room - or Hangout - and then you all kind of get in there.

90
00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:31.660
Now over here you can see we've got the green start broadcast button at the bottom and that

91
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.630
that will actually start recording and also start live streaming ...

92
00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:41.910
if you look at the links thing down here you get a YouTube page and so if you do click

93
00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.540
the start broadcast button which of course is entirely up to you. I pretty much record

94
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.650
and broadcast everything I do ...

95
00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:51.960
like to be there for the future alien archeologists but also just to be available generally for

96
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:53.410
others to review ...

97
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:58.440
then this YouTube page which is initially the stream then becomes the recording of the

98
00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.800
session which I think is very very useful.

99
00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.700
I totally love that feature.

100
00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.711
So there you go, I hope that will help you all start and run your own Hangouts for pair

101
00:08:04.711 --> 00:08:05.711
programming.

102
00:08:05.711 --> 00:08:05.919
Bye for now :-)
