00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So let's talk about managing chores.

1
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Now what are chores? … Now, you may - given that you've - um

2
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you've seen Pivotal Tracker and you're a

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
bit familiar with Agile development …

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you've got some idea about about chores …

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
um - the important thing really is to distinguish chores from user stories

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
they're things that …

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
uh-

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
need to be done but they don't provide any direct obvious value to the customer.

9
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So typically that's

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
um… you know - essential

11
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
jobs establishing frameworks or putting support in

12
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that - you know - ultimately will support

13
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
… other - other stories

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
they're kind of just stuff that kind of has to be done

15
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
... though ultimately you know one wants as many chores as possible to be -

16
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to be automated -

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but that's the kind of ongoing thing of identifying you know where to put the

18
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000
effort in about what to -

19
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what to automate.

20
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I mean …

21
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
you know, of course -

22
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with the term chores

23
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000
makes it sound like they might be

24
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
basic or menial jobs but actually they can be

25
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
very complex and - you know - require as

26
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
much skill and expertise as implementing

27
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you know - a complex … complex feature so

28
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you know - you will be at least partially

29
00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
familiar with Pivotal Tracker as a

30
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
as a result of having done the

31
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
169 Engineering Software-as-a-Service course …

32
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we'll be talking more about - you know -

33
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
the bigger picture with Pivotal Tracker

34
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
next week but … let's have a quick look

35
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
… at some of the … um … autumn projects here from Agile Ventures

36
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
these are all open and public

37
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and you can go to them and see

38
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you know - a real - a real project working there

39
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
but so we can see how for example here in the current thing we've got

40
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
um … you know -

41
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
there was a chore there to fix some broken domain name stuff

42
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
there was a domain name issue

43
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
uh-

44
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that - that was previously working - it broke.

45
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I mean it's - you know - arguably the customer

46
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
must have the … their - their site working in the

47
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
right location but - you know -

48
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
see, you could - sort of - all these things … - sort of

49
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
as long as you're a team is using a

50
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
consistent … metric for establishing that

51
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
this is what's going to be a chore and what's going to be a bug

52
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we could have called that a bug rather than a chore

53
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but often - if we have a look at some of the other bits & pieces -

54
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
- and now will that not go away?

55
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
go on …

56
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
uh- if we go back here

57
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
we can see that, for example,

58
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
adding code climate integration

59
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
into into the system - you know - in order

60
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to check, because of code metrics,

61
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
automatically against pull requests …

62
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that's something that the - you know -

63
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the customer is not going to ask for - but it's going to be kinda

64
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
useful for the development team

65
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and we'd like to have … going on …

66
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So that's - that's a good example of a - of a chore.

67
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The interesting thing is the impact of chores …

68
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
… they kind of have a

69
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
negative effect on the business -

70
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
business value output

71
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and they're reducing velocity … they're not usually assigned points -

72
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they're things that have got to be

73
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
done. You might be tempted,

74
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and people often are, to say

75
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
"Well you know this is going to take - you know - what?

76
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
One or two points?" to sort of … you want to estimate

77
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
how long they're going to take - but

78
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Pivotal and others strongly recommend against doing that.

79
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's sort of - they just sort of - it's part of the cost of -

80
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of being in business … and so -

81
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
you know -

82
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the time that it takes to get those chores done -

83
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
along with the the features is kind of …

84
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
ends up - you know - helping with the … the uh …

85
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
velocity calculation … but

86
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
more on that when we come to it next next week.

87
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Uh, yeah - they can also represent

88
00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
you know - code debt, sort of refactoring needs to be done,

89
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
you know - points of dependency on other teams.

90
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You don't necessarily know in advance what your chores are going to be -

91
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
they sort of you know just come up each week

92
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and … uh - sort keeping it …

93
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
it's very important to keep a track of

94
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
all these things that need to be done as well as the things

95
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that uh … you know -

96
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the user stories that have real business value

97
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and …

98
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
get - to a certain extent

99
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
the automatic velocity of calculation can -

100
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
can free you up from having to worry about -

101
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
about you know exactly how much …

102
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
they - they take up in terms of resources, time spent …

103
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
um, so - they can you know they can be high priority

104
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
um - it can be that a critical chore

105
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000
you know, with a bit of infrastructure

106
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
has to be done in order

107
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to support some of the some of the story

108
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
maybe multiple stories - multiple teams even …

109
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and so,

110
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you know - coordinating, getting these done, is - is important …

111
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
um… and it's … you know - that's where

112
00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in systems like Tracker

113
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
where you can reorder things

114
00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and put things into one sprint or another

115
00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
um … is - is very useful … but the key thing here

116
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
really, for - you know -

117
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
individuals, centralized teams, distributed teams,

118
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is, you know - remembering these things need to be done

119
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
… kind of, distinguishing, in your mind

120
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
from the -

121
00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the high-level user stories that then are

122
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
really driving business value and,

123
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
you know - choosing out those things that need to be chores

124
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
but that's something - again, I think - you know - continually using

125
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
systems like Pivotal where all of the work you're doing

126
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is being broken into

127
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
uh … you know - high-level user stories,

128
00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
chores, bugs … and so forth

129
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is definitely the way to go.

130
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We don't make as much use, I think, as we should do

131
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
of releases … it's partly, you know - it's just,

132
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
these open source projects for non-profit organizations

133
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
are slightly slower -

134
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
slower paced … but yes -

135
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
understanding chores … uh - very important!
