Hi.

1
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.800
So I want to talk to you about prerequisites for being a teaching assistant, or T.A.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.999
I also want to tell you about their role and the importance of the TA's.

3
00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.669
The pre-requisites are that you've completed the 169 courses.

4
00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.570
Specifically that you need to have completed the 169.1 course in order to be a TA for the

5
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.970
169.1 course.

6
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.570
And completed 169.2 to be a TA for the 169.2 course.

7
00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.300
So that's a critical thing, if you've never taken the Engineering Software as a Service

8
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.199
course on edX before then you might be in a difficult position to be a TA.

9
00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:37.899
Although I guess if you're a Rails ninja and you know everything there is to know about

10
00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.690
Rails and Agile development then get in touch and we can probably sort something out.

11
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.899
What we're also angling for is you to have to completed this ESaaS managing distributed

12
00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.829
teams course, which is this course that you are taking now and that's available on edX

13
00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.600
edge, which is another edX course framework.

14
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.059
We're also looking for you to have a certain amount of time available to commit to working

15
00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:02.109
with students; preferably a few hours a day but of course as much or as little as you

16
00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:03.819
can spare.

17
00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:07.409
Really we'd love however much time you can give us, but if you're only going to be available

18
00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.490
for less than, say, three minutes a week then we probably can't work together so easily.

19
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.689
So that's the key prerequisites for being a TA, but what about the role of the TA?

20
00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.960
So the TA is the student's personal connection to the course.

21
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.149
The students have access to material, they have the videos, they have the autograders,

22
00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.439
they have the forums and so on, but the TA is kind of the face of the course for the

23
00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.420
student.

24
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.659
They're the person who might spend the most time actually giving direct human interaction

25
00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.829
through the course so that's very important.

26
00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.630
And the role of the TA, as well as being the personal connection, is to be the mentor to

27
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.200
assist students with problems that they're having with the coursework, with comprehending

28
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.840
some of the difficult concepts in the course and so on.

29
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.039
Another thing that's really valuable for TA's to do is report courseware issues

30
00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.600
We've had some great bug reporting from TA's that have allowed us to fix a lot of issues

31
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.469
with the course, and it's not just reporting, you could even get involved with helping fix

32
00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:01.380
things.

33
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.149
For example with the development of the courseware, and also for the autograders.

34
00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.729
There are big open source programming projects behind the autograders that some TA's have

35
00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.170
got really deeply involved in and that's all there if you're interested in it.

36
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.040
However these are the key roles of TA's in the first instance.

37
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.900
So why it was important we have TA's?

38
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.190
It's a big course with thousands of students who are all trying to master material which

39
00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.409
in turns can be difficult and challenging.

40
00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.800
All the students are spread out over the world and are awake at different times of the global

41
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.280
cycle and so we need a sizable number of TA's in all different timezones.

42
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.790
We really need to have TA's around the world who can respond to those students' needs.

43
00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.680
Ultimately there are some very advanced students who can maybe get through the course material

44
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.230
without any interaction with other humans, although I think that those students are missing

45
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.099
out on great aspects of the course if that's what they do.

46
00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.659
Many students will need a guide, they will need guidance from mentors who understand

47
00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:59.860
the material and the process and the TA's are critical in providing this sort of help.

48
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.610
So you might be asking what's the relation to distributed teams here?

49
00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.370
Because there are hundreds of them, the TA's themselves are a distributed team who need

50
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.840
to work together and support one another.

51
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.409
The students themselves are also then an even larger distributed group and they'll form

52
00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:16.830
small teams for pairing on assignments and also we're moving towards having projects

53
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.760
in the 169 course with small groups of students collaborating and using the Agile development

54
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.239
methods.

55
00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.970
We're particularly looking towards a day in the not too distant future when TA's will

56
00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:27.950
be project managing those sort of teams.

57
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.939
Thus we think it's very important for you as TAs to learn all about distributed teams

58
00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.409
and teamwork, to help with being part of the big distributed TA team and also in the future

59
00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.299
for working with teams of students.
