00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.780
Hey so let's talk about deploying to the cloud. The cloud!

1
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.320
... I'm not sure if I like the term "cloud" ... it's used a lot these days

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.660
we mean stuff out there, in the internets, in the interwebs ...

3
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.349
there are also these two mnemonics I-a-a-S

4
00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.820
and P-a-a-S or Infrastructure-as-a-Service and Platform-as-a-Service

5
00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.869
that are really, they are changing the game

6
00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.550
and they're changing not just the way that people get their software

7
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.720
out there and get them to their customers but also how teams

8
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.939
collaborate ... what's happening is that it's

9
00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.130
you know becoming less and less … common to have your own

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.820
you know - server boxes in your office - actual computers running in your office that

11
00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.600
host your code. I can remember back in the day when that was

12
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.329
you know that was often how it was you know the servers might be a in data center but you'd

13
00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.890
sort of

14
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.969
... you'd have physical access to them

15
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.710
and that was sort of the norm when you wanted to get some sort of service

16
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.039
make it available to people you know on the web ...

17
00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:00.760
or on the internet. You know there are now various companies that offer

18
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.820
hosting at different levels of granularity ...

19
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.689
you've probably heard these terms as a result of taking the 169 course before

20
00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:10.770
... Dave and Armando have talked about that ... Infrastructure-as-a-Service ...

21
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.170
a good example of that would be Amazon Web Services which you may well have you may

22
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.790
well have done

23
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.030
of the assignments for the 169 course

24
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.640
on an EC2 instance .. with Amazon ...

25
00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.350
... and then very likely you will have deployed ...

26
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.100
applications to a Platform-as-a-Service such as such as ... Heroku

27
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.229
but yeah, let's talk a little bit more about the differences between

28
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.079
these two or how they fit into the bigger picture. There are all these

29
00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.810
different kinds of cloud service models

30
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350
great diagram here that's available on Wikipedia also a great article there

31
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.090
that you can read about the differences between these different things

32
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
we're going to concern ourselves today with Platform-as-a-Service

33
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.530
and Infrastructure-as-a-Service. In fact particularly focusing on platform as a

34
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.000
service

35
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.350
and Heroku which is one example of that in particular

36
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.119
which of course many of you will be familiar with already but it's you know great to have a

37
00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.659
refresher on these things ...

38
00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.280
one: because it's so useful for distributed teams and also because ... I

39
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.540
think it's a key sticking point

40
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.830
for students ... in the 169 Engineering Software as a Service course

41
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.180
... you can also see we've got, have I got the Kindle edition

42
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.170
here ... it's chapter 12 in the the latest in the new

43
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.170
1.0 edition has got ...

44
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
you know  - an overview of this Platform-as-a-Service, Infrastructure-as-a-Service

45
00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.360
and various other good stuff. So do ... y'know have a read you know

46
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.800
reading the chapter ... certainly the beginning of that chapter will go well with -

47
00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.650
this week's - this week's work … but it's really about

48
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.040
... I guess the kind of how low level access

49
00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.540
you're you're getting.  Infrastructure-as-a-Service gives you more access to the

50
00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.040
underlying system and then gradually you get less and less as we go up this

51
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.569
stack but let's let's talk more about that Infrastructure-as-a-Service

52
00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.450
or IaaS ... so as admittedly the key

53
00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.099
difference now is that you don't have access to the hardware, you can't

54
00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.159
phone up Amazon and say I would like to go and see my server. I mean maybe you can but they will say

55
00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.909
"No, that's not really part of the deal"

56
00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.489
what they're offering is you know ... some virtual machine

57
00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.879
on to which you can deploy things .. not just deploy

58
00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.920
code but you can actually - you know - choose as as many of you I am sure know

59
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.650
you can choose which operating system you want to put - to put in there and

60
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.190
you know that's up to you ... to get what you want on it to do what it wants

61
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.480
but you know keeping it running keeping it you know fed with power and keeping it at the right

62
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.040
temperature

63
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.459
you know all the sort of physical things that's now the service that something

64
00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:31.140
like Amazon

65
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.049
is - is providing and then often you know these Infrastructure-as-a-Service

66
00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.000
will provides lot of things that you would otherwise have to be bothered with

67
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.170
which is sort of like back up of the system

68
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.230
... securities, firewalls, load balancing - all … different stuff. You know getting the

69
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.379
actually the rights to the software - and so on and so forth and

70
00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.599
so forth ... and so this is - you know - very convenient

71
00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.040
... Dave has got you know wonderful examples talking talking about

72
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.150
... I forget is it with the FarmVille folks

73
00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.010
... you know scaling their ... you know scaling through their enormous growth

74
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.500
at the beginning using just a credit card account with ... with Amazon

75
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.989
so that's - you know - Infrastructure-as-a-Service ...

76
00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.220
not critical I guess to - to understand

77
00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.459
Infrastructure as a Service in order to ...

78
00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.620
you know make it through the 169 a Engineering Software as a Service course

79
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.160
... you know if you are using an EC2 instance to - to - to run your version of the

80
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.740
virtual machine

81
00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.280
then yes - that's that's very important but actually you can kind of

82
00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.020
not worry about it too much. From a distributed team point of view it's very important to

83
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.650
understand

84
00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.460
the difference between ... using something like EC2 or something like Heroku

85
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.370
and how - there - you know which ... you know how you should be making a choice between

86
00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:46.460
those … those two alternatives ... but the key thing really is the Infrastructure-as-a-Service

87
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.110
you've got

88
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.699
low-level access you can kind of choose your OS and you can you pretty much y'know

89
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.070
build anything you want on there. So there's a lot of flexibility ...

90
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.419
but that does mean you know a fair more bit of work.

91
00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:01.320
Another alternative is going up another level of abstraction shall we say

92
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.650
is to go to Platform-as-a-Service ... like like Heroku or Ninefold or someone

93
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.270
like that

94
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.130
AppFog I think is another one and so this one it's its the Platform-as-a-Service is kind of built on

95
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.820
the Infrastructure-as-a-Service ... but what it critically has it now they've

96
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.000
made a decision

97
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.190
for you ... about what the operating system is gonna be

98
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.449
likely what the database is going to be ... you may have some control over the Runtime

99
00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:24.039
Environment

100
00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:27.740
... you - you know - and framework but there may be restrictions on which frameworks

101
00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.070
are available; whether you can use ... Sinatra or Django or Rails or all these

102
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.500
different -

103
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.810
you know - different - different things but so as

104
00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.930
many of you will be familiar with from Heroku or other Platform-as-a-Service

105
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.080
... you are not at ... you know when you're going into it you are not saying - right - I want to

106
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:45.940
choose to have a Ubuntu or I want to choose to have

107
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.630
... you know windows or what have you. You're saying - right -

108
00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.900
... I've got an app that I've made you know in Rails

109
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.479
... is of course the classic one that we did in Engineering Software as a Service

110
00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.590
and then - all - you know - as well as - as we had in IaaS - as well as you not having to worry

111
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:02.710
so much about

112
00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.930
the hardware, load balancing, firewalls, security. Although - you know - still -

113
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.940
you need to be aware of - you can still, you know, encounter problems at

114
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.180
... the higher-level but at a lower-level you don't have to worry about those and

115
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.319
now in principle with Platform-as-a-Service you don't have to worry about

116
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.729
you know - uh - what was the operating system what was the database. I mean -

117
00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:22.850
you know it's sort of set up for you you don't have to set up your own Postgres

118
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.199
database ... Heroku will do it for you.

119
00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.490
We've got a nice diagram here from Franky Boucher

120
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.800
... which we've replicated

121
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.840
I think it shows you kinda on one side on the left side here

122
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.110
we're got Infrastructure-as-a-Service where you need to decide on these things on the top of

123
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.069
the stack the middleware, the runtime, the database

124
00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.380
... but the lower level thing here the operating system, virtualization,

125
00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:49.449
... servers, storage and networking is kind of managed by the

126
00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.900
provider. You may have, be able to choose which operating system you want but they're

127
00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:55.479
you know saying what's gonna be available for you and you can see here 'cause of

128
00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:56.770
quite clearly because if we look on the

129
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.150
right-hand side; is it left right? I always get confused my left and right, but anyway ... yeah blue side

130
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.319
left side, Infrastructure-as-a-Service. On the right side got Platform-as-a-

131
00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:03.919
Service.

132
00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.620
So now decisions about the database and the runtime and the middleware

133
00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.120
are now managed by the provider and you

134
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.389
really deal with the data and the applications. So

135
00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:18.470
... the advantages of this are that you can focus

136
00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:21.800
uh - 100%; maybe should we ... maybe we should say - like - mainly

137
00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:25.729
on your application code; because you do have to start being aware of

138
00:07:26.229 --> 00:07:29.560
you know issues that affect ... you can focus more

139
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.360
let's say that we could focus more on your application code ... rather than on the on

140
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.300
the lower-level

141
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.039
issues - but what is fantastic is that you can

142
00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:41.289
scale up and down the amount of resources that are available to that - to the extent that you've

143
00:07:41.289 --> 00:07:41.849
got ...

144
00:07:41.849 --> 00:07:45.430
that you can afford to pay for it - and there are other lots of ...

145
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.039
infrastructure components that you can add in. This is I think one of the really nice

146
00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:49.699
things about

147
00:07:49.699 --> 00:07:53.840
about Heroku for your apps is you can add support for additional backups for ...

148
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.620
email

149
00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:58.479
connections for all sorts of things ... you know for extra logging and this that and

150
00:07:58.479 --> 00:07:58.979
the other

151
00:07:58.979 --> 00:08:02.430
and there's sort of a plug-and-play you know you need to get set up with let's say New

152
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:03.330
Relic logging

153
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:06.550
... sorry ... New Relic monitoring you know you can do that

154
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:09.770
relatively easily because it's it's already provided

155
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:12.900
in the framework if you want to switch it on. So let's get a bit more

156
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.610
into Heroku.  Many of you will already be familiar with Heroku I think they're

157
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:20.819
one of the most venerable Platform-as-a-Service

158
00:08:20.819 --> 00:08:23.949
... groups. Advantages ...

159
00:08:23.949 --> 00:08:26.990
of them are you know all the advantages that you'd expect

160
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:30.830
from using Platform-as-a-Service I think one of the things that I particularly like is

161
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:32.070
... the ability to

162
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:35.070
deploy those apps using Git ...

163
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:40.110
and that just, you know, makes a lot of sense - you know you've got your

164
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.719
versioning system which is saying - right, this is exactly, this is the code

165
00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:47.149
that's working! This it the working code! Right let's have that code, let's have the working

166
00:08:47.149 --> 00:08:47.570
code

167
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:51.080
on the server running in production for the for the clients ...

168
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.450
but it does have, so and you know you can do Git from the command line. You can also do quite - there's a lot of

169
00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.350
stuff you can do

170
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:59.410
through the the user interface for Heroku

171
00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:03.640
and you know and then many things are also accessible both through the

172
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.589
command-line interface

173
00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:08.010
and the the graphical user interface and we'll see some

174
00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:11.470
examples of that shortly but first let's talk about some of the constraints

175
00:09:11.470 --> 00:09:14.529
... although ... it the deployment is dead

176
00:09:14.529 --> 00:09:18.640
dead simple ... I mean although arguably there are even some services that are even simpler than

177
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.880
Heroku ... and the - you know -

178
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.950
there's easy scaling. The constraints really is the sort of section is that

179
00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:29.160
there's a certain amount of things that you get for free

180
00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.570
and, you know, what - as long as you're staying within that free tier

181
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:36.390
... you know that's that's a great playground for working out what you want

182
00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:37.080
to do

183
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.810
... seeing if you're kind of prototypical system that you've built is

184
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:44.790
is working for the customer base for the user base that you imagine

185
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:48.899
... but so once you start to move out of that and you want -

186
00:09:48.899 --> 00:09:52.730
you know - logging that goes back further; you want ... you know more bandwidth, you

187
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.140
need a bigger database and so on

188
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.089
then you are you are going to need ... to start paying some money but ...

189
00:09:58.089 --> 00:10:01.420
it's a usually, you know, getting started is gonna be a while

190
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:04.790
before you - hit those limits and you can have established …

191
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.220
you know - if your ... if anybody is actually interested in what your - what you're offering

192
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.519
before you - before you hit them ... so they, I mean, they have this web-based tool, let's just

193
00:10:12.519 --> 00:10:13.300
show you

194
00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.480
actually my, you know this - this is my Heroku dashboard ... I as a result of

195
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.750
y'know doing lots of example deploys for lots of people I have you know all of these

196
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.200
different

197
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.250
example apps here ... what were we going to talk about here we're gonna

198
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.670
... I mean there's you know you can - it's - it's - it's a nice interface to manage

199
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:29.200
things through

200
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.600
you can create new apps from there.  I'm more often do that from the command-line

201
00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.649
... and ... yeah ... have

202
00:10:36.649 --> 00:10:39.790
I got … I guess if we go into - let's see -

203
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:43.760
the AgileVentures ... organizations there. We've got some of our develop

204
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.110
... websites - I don't know how much we've got but we can have a look at the app

205
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:50.160
… but you can see here for example - I mean you get

206
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.149
the Postgres ... you know out of the box so to speak but

207
00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:57.230
we've added here the paper trail, so that's a logging app and you can see

208
00:10:57.899 --> 00:11:00.940
you know all of the Add-Ons for Heroku

209
00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.130
you know you get they have free tiers and then they have you know, if you wanna

210
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:05.470
get more and more functionality

211
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.390
you can you know pay. So if we click on here and say get Add-Ons

212
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:13.779
we can look for ... you know there's a huge huge load of different Add-Ons

213
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:17.610
that you can used to do just about just about anything really

214
00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.620
and and this you know the the ability to sort of plug-and-play

215
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.339
with all the different bits and pieces the things that you that you need - from

216
00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:25.089
backups

217
00:11:25.089 --> 00:11:28.089
... you know through extra kind of search thing ...

218
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:32.120
we've got ... I haven't even really scraped

219
00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.709
the surface.  There's about ... five or ten Add-Ons that we regularly use

220
00:11:36.709 --> 00:11:39.920
... in AgileVentures, but ... being able to

221
00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.079
y'know access that in this fashion is - is very very very powerful

222
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.200
... yeah and and so I guess particularly as regards

223
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.610
... teams; I mean whether you're a centralized team or a distributed team

224
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.410
then the ability to manage your organization through through Heroku

225
00:11:54.410 --> 00:11:55.810
so we have our AgileVentures one

226
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:58.870
here ... very very handy you can have - you know

227
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.889
give the the team of people access to it but I think particularly

228
00:12:02.889 --> 00:12:05.709
... while this is this is very useful for the centralized team it's

229
00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:07.360
extraordinarily useful

230
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.180
for the distributed team ... who are not in the the same office. I mean

231
00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:14.310
back in the day - you know a distributed - if the

232
00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:17.540
you know - if you were relying upon physical access to

233
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.680
the server which was in one place that was very difficult you would have to

234
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.010
have some person there

235
00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:25.089
now because we've got a Platform-as-a-Service like Heroku

236
00:12:25.089 --> 00:12:28.139
a distributed team like AgileVentures can -

237
00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:31.410
you know we can give everybody you know necessarily who needs it

238
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.769
access to this team thing. They can be all-round anywhere in the world as long as they've got an internet connection

239
00:12:35.769 --> 00:12:39.010
and they can get in here and be saying oh right we need - we want to try out this

240
00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.060
additional add-on

241
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.399
we wanna do this we wanna do that ... it really suddenly

242
00:12:43.399 --> 00:12:46.410
makes the distributed team ... much more powerful

243
00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.529
... and then I mean the flip side of that is you know by, rather than

244
00:12:50.529 --> 00:12:53.740
relying upon being in the same office to look over at your colleague's computer and he

245
00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.019
shows you all this is

246
00:12:55.019 --> 00:12:58.120
is working here the process of actually deploying

247
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.260
to the to the cloud means that you know you have a endpoint

248
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:05.550
URL that all of your team can look at and they can look at it everywhere in the world. So that's an

249
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:09.690
actually all of your customers, your potential customers and user testing, it's well, I'm getting ahead of myself as

250
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:10.540
I often

251
00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:13.589
do ... but yes ... it's the kind of thing

252
00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:17.779
all of you will I think be familiar with Heroku to a degree because there were

253
00:13:17.779 --> 00:13:20.800
... you know ... there were assignments in the

254
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.060
169 course that involved deployment to Heroku but you may have only

255
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.490
done it through the command line, you

256
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.029
you may not have spent much time exploring the dashboard and the support for

257
00:13:29.029 --> 00:13:32.170
organizations and this that and the other - but there's really is a lot there

258
00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:35.180
... and very powerful and of course not just with Heroku

259
00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.450
but there's many other ...

260
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.740
good organizations providing a similar Platform-as-a-

261
00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.850
... service ...

262
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.720
offerings and you know they're all busy competing with each other to

263
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.560
make the best offering but so the other thing that we can do is we can use

264
00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:53.519
the command-line

265
00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:56.660
interface to you know create applications we can see

266
00:13:57.269 --> 00:14:01.750
that I've busily had lotsa fun creating I mean I need to go through and clear these out

267
00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.730
but very very ... it's so easy and perhaps too easy

268
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:09.320
to create and rename your apps

269
00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.480
you can take backups, you can configure the add-ons from the ...

270
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.139
database

271
00:14:13.139 --> 00:14:16.199
... and you can also get an interactive shell

272
00:14:16.199 --> 00:14:19.339
into your application as I think you may have seen in the ...

273
00:14:20.589 --> 00:14:24.310
169 course but so you know if you if you haven't signed up for

274
00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:27.959
Heroku, it's free, you know ... that's a great way to get started

275
00:14:27.959 --> 00:14:31.310
I guess what I'm gonna do is just run through ...

276
00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:34.730
kinda I guess outside the context of 169 I mean - you know - this - you may already be

277
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:35.699
familiar with this

278
00:14:35.699 --> 00:14:39.470
... let's let's just see how relatively straightforward it all is

279
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:42.610
to get a little quick Ruby on Rails app ... up

280
00:14:42.610 --> 00:14:46.010
onto ... onto Heroku ... and then also

281
00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:49.560
talk about some of the common issues that can come up, the blockages, I think particularly that

282
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:50.199
effect

283
00:14:50.199 --> 00:14:54.160
... students and so on but I've got what've I got going here, I've got

284
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.160
... I've got a little, I'm in my little directory here

285
00:14:57.699 --> 00:15:02.070
so let's have "rails new" and shall we call it let's call this

286
00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:05.199
... this ... managing distributed teams

287
00:15:05.199 --> 00:15:08.630
MDT; managing distributed teams app so there

288
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.860
and we're going to get our little rails app created. You can you can do this I mean

289
00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:18.199
in some ways arguably doing this with ... Sinatra is a more straightforward and then we'll go and do

290
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:22.709
the bundle install in the background. Hopefully my network connection is fast enough

291
00:15:22.709 --> 00:15:26.019
to make that ... not too ...

292
00:15:26.019 --> 00:15:29.279
cumbersome. So let's just sort of talk about the other things that we're going to be doing. What I would do next

293
00:15:29.279 --> 00:15:32.730
is I would ... jump into my app directory make sure that the

294
00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:35.730
Heroku Gem is installed and then - this is the kind of key thing

295
00:15:36.259 --> 00:15:40.130
is about - we would use git to deploy into the - into the cloud

296
00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:43.519
and ... probably through doing the 169 course you've sort of become -

297
00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:46.759
sort of approximately familiar with this - but I think this is one of the most

298
00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:48.560
fascinating things.  Actually the the best

299
00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.370
I shall just go and grab the diagram; this is the the Coursera Startup Engineering

300
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:55.279
... course had a fantastic diagram which I think is yet to be matched in the

301
00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.550
diagrams that I've seen

302
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:59.660
that show the relationship - actually here between this is

303
00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:03.980
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service and and Git and so on.

304
00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.610
And so ... specifically in the

305
00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:10.639
Startup Engineering course on Coursera which I highly recommend by the way

306
00:16:10.639 --> 00:16:13.769
... they were sort of specifying - you know -

307
00:16:13.769 --> 00:16:16.920
everyone should use the EC2. They didn't distribute a virtual machine

308
00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.829
in quite the same way ... but so this model would be if you were working

309
00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:25.070
on EC2 for the 169 course this will be the same sort of set up. So you have

310
00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:25.829
your

311
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:29.019
personal laptop your SSH-ing into

312
00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:32.350
the box that you have in the cloud from Amazon

313
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.810
and you know so you're interacting with that remotely

314
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:39.759
and then you're, you know, developing some code you're pushing it to GitHub and

315
00:16:39.759 --> 00:16:41.850
storing it and or pulling it back as necessary

316
00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:45.190
... once you've got it working you know on your

317
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:48.959
Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Amazon EC2 box you could then push it to Heroku

318
00:16:48.959 --> 00:16:53.110
... using git again and it ends up you know at some end point that you're

319
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.610
user can - can browse to ... the

320
00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:59.880
situation if you actually doing things on the machine as I'm gonna do them directly

321
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:03.529
now myself then you know the Amazon Infrastructure-as-a-Service

322
00:17:03.529 --> 00:17:07.929
component is not there and this diagram becomes a little

323
00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:11.510
simpler. I still think this is one of the best diagrams that I've seen so far and

324
00:17:11.510 --> 00:17:14.589
maybe one day we'll work out how to make great diagrams like that; but

325
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:18.510
let's go and see what's happening over here so we've got all of our ...

326
00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:21.890
all of our libraries have been installed with bundle now

327
00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:25.740
if we're gonna go into managing distributed teams. We've got our new managing distributed teams

328
00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:29.059
app ... lets do gem install

329
00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:32.510
heroku. I don't know that that's actually a critical

330
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.440
thing here that we need to have it; but we certainly do need to do …

331
00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.860
I'll put that into the background there for the moment ...

332
00:17:39.860 --> 00:17:42.220
- did that, did you not like being put in the background?

333
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.049
background

334
00:17:43.049 --> 00:17:47.130
mmm - we'll see what happens there. Let's

335
00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:50.130
do 'git init' there ... and

336
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:53.620
yeah, we'll just add there you go, you see it's got the gem installed there

337
00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.690
... I think I had it already weee!

338
00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:59.690
things are happening in the background wohoo okay all right

339
00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.360
so 'git' and then I'm going to do add 'dot' that's - that's

340
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.480
you can see the command there - so we're going to git add stuff; let's look at

341
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:07.620
'git status'

342
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:11.970
and see what's going on again, and is there lots of things going on?

343
00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.559
all rights so we've got you know all the files because we want to be somewhat

344
00:18:15.559 --> 00:18:16.309
selective

345
00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:19.650
about which files we were putting in for a Rails app but just in the interest of

346
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.120
speed lets ... just get this

347
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:26.410
going as 'git commit

348
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.490
minus m ... initial commit'

349
00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:33.650
so I've just created a little Rails app there ...

350
00:18:33.650 --> 00:18:36.840
now we could go ahead and I guess the idea

351
00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.360
is to generate a little scaffold we've got here from the Rails command line you can

352
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:43.870
generate things.  Let's imagine, oh I don't know

353
00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:49.539
the ... let's imagine that we ... you know we just sort of create a very simple

354
00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:54.059
a simple app so this ... scaffolding will create the views and the

355
00:18:54.059 --> 00:18:55.660
templates and this that and the other for us

356
00:18:55.660 --> 00:18:59.470
... I guess shall I just use the example of the high score? I'm kind of struggling with ooh I should

357
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.720
make something up, something relevant to managing distributed teams, but imagine that it's a

358
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.250
high score for

359
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.630
you know let's call it for the team; it's a the high score; there you go, let's

360
00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.610
have team there

361
00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.820
So by generating the scaffold ... we're gonna put

362
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.400
you know a lot of little bits and pieces that we need in place

363
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:18.549
we can ... just locally if I do rake

364
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:21.580
db:migrate

365
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.570
let's see if it will just sort that out for me? Yep so we've got a little something in there, and

366
00:19:25.570 --> 00:19:28.870
if I do "rails s" then, and this is gonna be very familiar

367
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.580
... well at least you may not have seen the scaffold but if we now just go to

368
00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:36.880
localhost three thousand and what did we do, did we call it?

369
00:19:37.450 --> 00:19:40.580
team? Are we now going to have a teams thing there? There we go oops

370
00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:43.679
we haven't got oh what are they called? ah, they are called high scores okay ...

371
00:19:43.679 --> 00:19:46.679
high scores like so

372
00:19:46.679 --> 00:19:50.150
and there we go so you have a new high score or team and they are called

373
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.150
the west coast team and they have a score of 100 and

374
00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:56.730
create high score and now we have some

375
00:19:56.730 --> 00:20:01.169
scores. So you know the scaffold's rather boring but it's got you know basic

376
00:20:01.169 --> 00:20:04.539
functionality in there for a Rails app I think it's always ... I mean some people don't like

377
00:20:04.539 --> 00:20:05.860
the scaffolding. Is it too much magic

378
00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:09.289
I always think that was an exciting part of Rails - that you could do that

379
00:20:09.289 --> 00:20:13.120
but so now ... what we can do here is we can ...

380
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.270
'heroku create' and I will add to my

381
00:20:16.270 --> 00:20:19.600
ever-increasing list of random Heroku

382
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.059
things. So we've created this one "gentle-beach-2829" like so

383
00:20:23.059 --> 00:20:27.900
... and then if we follow on ... I could have given it a special name but I didn't

384
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.309
... let's try 'git push heroku master' ...

385
00:20:31.309 --> 00:20:35.049
although of course - and I guess I should mention here; so there's

386
00:20:35.049 --> 00:20:39.850
often a place where people get tripped up is one: is getting the SSH keys set up

387
00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.230
to communicate with Heroku. I've got them already set up here on my OSX environment

388
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:48.250
... that's just … you know … it's an area where you may well find in the 169 course

389
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:49.460
that a lot of the students get

390
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:53.090
get stuck ... understanding what's going on there ... we've got ...

391
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:56.490
you know an assignment this week

392
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:59.539
to help you - you know work through that's that's just - you know -

393
00:20:59.539 --> 00:21:02.990
... when this is set up correctly it can be incredibly smooth.

394
00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:05.990
If it's not set up correctly and you don't have the SSH keys installed and so on

395
00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:09.630
it can be a real pain. It could be a real pain ... but so

396
00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:13.340
... another thing that ... I think is sort of fundamentally confusing here

397
00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.960
is so for example here I've created this app; I might be tempted now to do 'git push

398
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.980
heroku master' like so but ... if we look if we quickly do a 'git status'

399
00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.049
we'll see that actually all these parts of the scaffold ...

400
00:21:25.049 --> 00:21:28.970
won't have been ...  to be ... are not in my

401
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:32.320
local Git repository and so this is kind of absolutely key here

402
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.400
we need to do ... you know get this

403
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.720
... scaffold in there. So if I do "git commit -m" and

404
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.110
added scaffold like so ... put that in there

405
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:46.350
... you know now this is going to be ... I'm going to actually deploy

406
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:50.169
code that I have working on my system into the cloud ... so if we now

407
00:21:50.169 --> 00:21:52.330
try "git remote -v" we can see it's

408
00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.570
connected up the key ... the "heroku" to

409
00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:58.770
... 'gentle beach' there and if I do 'git push

410
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:02.049
heroku master'.  Notice that I'm not using GitHub here at all.  I'm just using my local Git

411
00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:02.789
repository

412
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:05.840
and ... using it to communicate with Heroku there ...

413
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:09.510
you could be also pushing it to GitHub but that's a that's another

414
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.860
thing. If we just go back to this

415
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.500
... diagram here. So in the simplest sense -

416
00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.980
you know - this side of the diagram over here - can I do it? I can't really select this in the way that I want.

417
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:23.679
But ... the actually you can see in the background there that it is pushing up that little

418
00:22:23.679 --> 00:22:27.980
Rails app for me ... in in the simplest version

419
00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:32.490
I'm just going from the laptop here and I'm pushing my code to Heroku and I

420
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:34.419
haven't even bothered with GitHub

421
00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:37.690
... and then that is gonna you know create an end point

422
00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.850
of an app that people can get to ... and so oh we didn't, oh no no

423
00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.280
... we've failed. Okay ...

424
00:22:48.650 --> 00:22:52.360
actually it's one of the reasons why ... going with a

425
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.360
Sinatra app is easier than going with the Rails app ...

426
00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.370
I've forgotten to do a couple of simple things which are

427
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:03.000
... all mentioned in the appendix in in the textbook

428
00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.049
but ... you need to make ... well because Heroku

429
00:23:06.049 --> 00:23:09.220
is using a Postgres database instead of SQLite we need to

430
00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:13.130
adjust our gem file so that SQLite is

431
00:23:13.130 --> 00:23:16.940
in the test and development groups and we've got our Postgres gem

432
00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.450
installed and then there's also ... we need to you know

433
00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:24.210
for the recent stuff on Rails on Heroku

434
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.320
we need to sets initialize_on_precompile equal to false

435
00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:31.770
and so but these are the kinds of things that can can really ...

436
00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.419
trip people up its you know and

437
00:23:35.419 --> 00:23:38.770
for me I do most of my com ... I'm more often

438
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:43.270
pushing to Heroku with an existing project that all these things are set in rather than doing it with

439
00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:43.590
a

440
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:47.830
completely new one ... but so having set those things and of course

441
00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.080
again ... having adjusted the app so that

442
00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.570
... I have checked all those changes into my local Git repository

443
00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.960
I can then successfully push to Heroku - which I've -

444
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:01.980
which I've done ... but then even having done so and if I ...

445
00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.020
go and grab in the URL that we've got that

446
00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.450
on we can still run into problems ... like here you'll often see this

447
00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:10.880
"we're sorry

448
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.250
but something went wrong" but that's to illustrate - you know - then

449
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:18.190
we can run our ... the commands from the command line to do the things that we need, for

450
00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:18.890
example

451
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:23.059
like if we were to do there 'heroku run rake db: migrate'

452
00:24:23.059 --> 00:24:26.730
... I guess I should have showed you that Heroku logs their

453
00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:29.940
... showing - you know ...

454
00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:33.080
and this is one of the key things that's challenging for

455
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:37.429
people maybe not necessarily familiar with ... Platform-as-a-Service and so on

456
00:24:37.429 --> 00:24:40.429
is the difference between running the integrations on their local machine

457
00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:44.270
and running migrations in the cloud ... anyway

458
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.169
hopefully this is a refresher for many of you there

459
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:51.370
but so now if we go over to here to our remote

460
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.370
system now we have high scores here and we could say

461
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:57.640
team, I don't know, let's say 'East Coast' and give you a score of '100'

462
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.620
as well and there we go we now have our Rails app

463
00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:05.200
running in the cloud. So you know it like with everything

464
00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.429
you know just so it can be as easy as that! Often you know

465
00:25:08.429 --> 00:25:12.250
even for a relatively experienced Heroku user you can run

466
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.870
run into issues with a new app

467
00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:19.309
but particularly for people coming in and you know

468
00:25:19.309 --> 00:25:22.760
encountering this stuff for the first time I think

469
00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.880
you know a good conceptual understanding of the difference between

470
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:29.820
you know your software running on the cloud and the software running on your local computer

471
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.210
absolutely essential; and we'll have some

472
00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.370
assignments that hopefully will help with that

473
00:25:36.370 --> 00:25:39.720
... and then there's other things so you know the

474
00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.740
something that can trip people up as a security issue is that you might

475
00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:46.669
you want to be using API keys for a service and so on and other secure things.

476
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:50.090
The temptation is, initially right, so we're deploying everything via Git, we need to sort of put that into

477
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.360
GitHub and so on ooh I don't know what's going on there

478
00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.840
... there's an extensive config framework to allow you to set

479
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.320
just those ... keys that are necessary in production and so on and so forth

480
00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:04.659
but that's just sort of scratching the surface there. It really is the tip of the

481
00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:05.270
iceberg

482
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:09.520
... Heroku and Ninefold and other systems like them are very powerful platforms

483
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.710
and you know it's sort of through the 169 course you may have

484
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:17.700
only pushed to Heroku once or twice and you know it's not something you necessarily got

485
00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:18.549
very familiar with

486
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:22.610
but ... you know ... as a TA for the 169

487
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.169
Engineering Software as a Service absolutely

488
00:26:26.169 --> 00:26:29.330
you know to getting like that really solid like what's going on with Heroku; you

489
00:26:29.330 --> 00:26:29.620
know

490
00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:33.880
the ... all the differences you know really helpful because it's kind of something that I

491
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.630
think many of the

492
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:38.720
students get can get stuck on. As a developer it's extraordinarily useful

493
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:42.710
you know, particularly in a distributed team where you can't just sort of show the person

494
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:45.169
sitting next to you oh look I've made this new interface.

495
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:48.169
By deploying it to Heroku you can you then get a URL

496
00:26:48.679 --> 00:26:51.850
you can immediately ... share that

497
00:26:51.850 --> 00:26:55.270
with whoever you know ... and that's just

498
00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.330
getting feedback on the thing that you've developed is absolutely key. So

499
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.610
... you know ... and it's not so much that you

500
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:07.470
are leaving ... I mean ... well I'll say in our AgileVentures projects you know often the

501
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.690
person deploying to

502
00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:12.890
Heroku will be kind of the team leader ... so you know absolutely essential that the team

503
00:27:12.890 --> 00:27:13.610
leader's got

504
00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:17.600
good skills there. They're being the person who's the

505
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:20.789
... as it were the guardian to see right all of the different

506
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:24.190
developer submissions they're going through and they're going to go into production right now

507
00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:27.210
y'know make sure that they actually get up there on to Heroku ...

508
00:27:27.210 --> 00:27:30.140
but the individual developers you know if they want to ... even if they are not

509
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:30.960
necessarily involved

510
00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:34.370
in day-to-day with that process they can be putting

511
00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:38.710
the - you know spikes - that they do ... we'll talk about those next ... you know features that

512
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.140
they worked on, user stories

513
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.440
put those up onto their own Heroku instances and share that with the rest the

514
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:43.860
team

515
00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.809
and - you know wherever they are world they can go and look at them and get

516
00:27:46.809 --> 00:27:47.470
feedback on

517
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:50.580
and so on and so forth. So ... yeah I hope this ...

518
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.110
you know ... encourages you to try out Platform-as-a-Service

519
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.549
... like Heroku if you haven't. If you aren't using it all day everyday anyway, and in

520
00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:58.370
which case you know

521
00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.370
... thank you for taking the time to listen

522
00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:05.299
... but do think I even if you are using it all day every day

523
00:28:05.299 --> 00:28:09.610
I think that the you know the supporting other team members who are not using

524
00:28:09.610 --> 00:28:12.330
so frequently or supporting students who are trying to learn about it

525
00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:16.950
kind of ... this ... the conceptual toolkit ... and thinking about where people get stuck

526
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.360
with - you know - getting the SSH keys set up

527
00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.480
and understanding the relationship between Git, Heroku and GitHub and all the little pieces

528
00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.860
that's you know a clear understanding of that will help you help others

529
00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:28.039
Alright
