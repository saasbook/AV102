00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
so I'd say that some the concept of the user story there is one of the key

1
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.019
things that comes out of the engineers offers service cause i think is a key a

2
00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.610
software engineering concept and i think it's you know imported i bleep up next

3
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.859
to here in his first so what is a user story the idea and you'll be familiar

4
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.070
with these as they occurred in the in the main MOOC but the idea you know for

5
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.330
it to recap is that they should be short simple people focused our stakeholders

6
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.260
we also call them and business focus so for example as a manager of a consulting

7
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.879
company in order to build my clients accurately I want to track employee time

8
00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.440
it's broken up into these this is a very standard sort of thing and why do we

9
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.750
need the user stories partly because you know we need to encourage participation

10
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.500
among stakeholders I see and there's some people who feel the value of these

11
00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.449
well I guess it's not so much that I think some people argue with within

12
00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.739
things like cucumber which then takes the user stories and breaks them into

13
00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.909
these scenarios and there's an argument to say that they're you know the clients

14
00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.180
never going to read those but i think the clients are often quite interested

15
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.540
in getting involved at this level at the user story having this you know having

16
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.630
the different kinds of stakeholders involved in writing out these user

17
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.950
stories really i think that the the key thing prep for any project before you

18
00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.340
write any to a coat or you even choose your framework or what have you is you

19
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.840
work out what are the needs for the system that you're building and if you

20
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.630
haven't worked that out you haven't got that straight then you know there's just

21
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.740
you know you got your sort of wandering around in the dark really so you know

22
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.619
closely tying the you know the requirements the business needs

23
00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.790
absolutely essential and they end up performing the basis for the for the

24
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.430
exception testing as we'll see shortly we talked about some cucumber and our

25
00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.790
spec and so on the again i mean i think the particular value that we see for

26
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.990
these i think i think for both centralized or decentralized distributed

27
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.920
teams is having a language description of the hi Louise story

28
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.480
as something so you know what when we work on understanding who it is what

29
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.930
wants what and why it has business values is just absolutely critical for

30
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:28.290
getting a run on the same page and I think particularly in a you know many

31
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.560
different developers from all the world different backgrounds coming in having

32
00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.250
those acceptance tests as well written out based on the user stories and so

33
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.340
that you then have ideally declarative cucumber stories describing you know

34
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.410
what's going on even if you never show those to the customer the you know

35
00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.250
between the developers you know who have different levels of experience with you

36
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.459
know whatever low-level coding it's just nice for them to have an English

37
00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.569
narrative description so they can all be clear that they're on DM the same page

38
00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.930
so you know the risk on extra format as David amala mondo presented in the main

39
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.970
course you know as some stakeholder so that I can you know achieve numbers need

40
00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.970
I want to be able to you know do this particular kind of thing on that to

41
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.840
ended up being your kind of feature request that you have there you know

42
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:23.790
ideal it the the surahs are smart little coverage of that in the textbook with us

43
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.200
you know be them being specific achievable relevant who's got something

44
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.260
we gotta jet they took them in different SMA irrelevant and time boxed so you

45
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.739
know this is I mean this is another sort of neck that comes over time is sort of

46
00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.600
working out these these user stories I think we have a particular trouble in

47
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.650
our products with them with time boxing them things often tend to get a bit a

48
00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.680
bit open ended but yes definitely do read chapter seven again onto I think I

49
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.130
mean some ways I would almost argue that this is this is sort of the entry point

50
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.739
I mean there's you know in some ways to understand cucumber perhaps you need you

51
00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.880
know the grass on the standing of different on the testing and Ruby and so

52
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.299
on but whenever you're sort of starting a new project this is this is the place

53
00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.690
where you come in come in with the user stories your own coming with you know

54
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.410
various Ruby code you write come in with some smot some user stories and so

55
00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.960
that's you know at the top level that's why we're starting this was going here

56
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.060
so you know what's not at user story you've

57
00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.710
got a little technical issues and chores I've attempt to rappers you get a bugs

58
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.030
getting documentation done although you know so plugging kids documented code

59
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.169
that's important and you know features about business needs I mean that this is

60
00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.650
you know the key thing you know there's many things that have to be done in

61
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.090
order the project forward and get something else the key thing is that you

62
00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.139
you know have to work out which are those small set of things that are going

63
00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.980
to really meet business needs and then work out from those the even smaller

64
00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.389
stuff that's going to be your MVP or your minimum viable product but so the

65
00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.570
the five wise are a technique that I think they've already presented is a

66
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.580
little bit refresher for everyone you know the user story should be able to

67
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.970
reach you know solid business value in five wise so for example about different

68
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.810
user story in order display my products as an online retailer I want to have a

69
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.790
catalog on my website and so we might ask why do you want to include the

70
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.960
catalog on your website and the answer is so we think this customer can see all

71
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.960
the varieties but the products and why should the customer see all the

72
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.490
varieties of the products and if we move down there it's a bit of choice and why

73
00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.000
do you want happen to be the choice they're more likely to buy if they they

74
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.479
find what they want and what you want but why you wanted to buy any things I

75
00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.510
can make money why do you wanna make money they don't you feel does this

76
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.660
although of course you know that you shouldn't exclude the idea that that is

77
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.620
is money the root of all evil I'm not sure it may be that's you know the tour

78
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.220
the Oerlikon is not specifically you know about commercial goal but being

79
00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.430
clear about all the different levels here and also interested assumptions

80
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.229
that are going in here is it the case that necessarily an extraordinarily wide

81
00:06:05.229 --> 00:06:09.190
choice you know it makes people more like to buy in some cases actually

82
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.960
narrowing the choice you know there's something that Sam Evans show that you

83
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.180
know depending upon how you know if you've it's about some people with the

84
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:20.620
three options they're more likely to choose one than if you put in them 25

85
00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.389
options they made us run away in fear like whoa anyhow but the important thing

86
00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.410
with any of this whole process of generating user stories and using three

87
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.139
were five cards that are mentioned in the court and so on to uncover the

88
00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:37.690
assumptions about what's needed and why do we think things are the case and you

89
00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.050
know whether you I don't know I guess at you know with the team in a single

90
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.460
office or you know in relative good physical proximity

91
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:50.690
there are more chances meeting of the water cooler to you know or in Maine

92
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.400
meetings to work out what's what's going on it becomes even more important in a

93
00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:00.319
distribute team to understand cover the different assumptions about why you're

94
00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:04.490
developing anything that you think is going to you know have some value to the

95
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:11.210
end users of your system so simplicity is just I mean is so important up and

96
00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:15.020
down every level from there from the user story to the unit test you know

97
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:19.580
everywhere you can inject simplicity and complexity that's the way to go so if

98
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.360
you've got sort of a higher more complex feature break that into individual

99
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.130
stories and it'd be very specific and avoid play business needs we've got some

100
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:33.800
good examples thereof you know example levels been specific you know from from

101
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.979
from David amando that you know the feature you user can search for movies

102
00:07:36.979 --> 00:07:40.759
with a vague but the user can search remove my title is more specific it's a

103
00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.370
simple example there so you know there are going to be sometimes just difficult

104
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:50.750
things that you don't know how to turn into a user story you know every

105
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:56.180
situation is different just you know break it down into components and keep

106
00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.740
asking yourself is this addressing some some key level business need and you

107
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:03.740
know what are the assumptions that we're making here and I did it should be a

108
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.949
dialogue between you and everybody involved in the product all the

109
00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:12.349
different stakeholders and you know we'll talk more next next week about the

110
00:08:12.349 --> 00:08:15.860
different kinds of you know online framework so you can use to help manage

111
00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.630
the development of user stories in the disability team but this yakhni

112
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:23.570
principle which I of natural I mean you ain't gonna need it I mean this is this

113
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:26.300
is the key thing that can often happen you get a group of developers together

114
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.099
wouldn't it be cool this really cool and you know lots of things get creative and

115
00:08:30.099 --> 00:08:35.240
the problem is really that complexity is the killer for every additional feature

116
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.800
there's an additional kind of n plus 1 interactions with all of the other

117
00:08:39.799 --> 00:08:44.180
existing features and you know sowed like simplicity simplicity modularity

118
00:08:44.179 --> 00:08:48.020
only building the very very very very smallest subset of the things that you

119
00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.520
need really is the way forward so let's use the stories and we'll see them

120
00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.490
connecting up with acceptance tests very shortly after

121
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.590
we've had a quick detour into chores alright bye for now
