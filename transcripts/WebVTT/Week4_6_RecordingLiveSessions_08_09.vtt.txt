00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.000
So, recording live sessions. We've already talked about recording

1
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.179
in hangouts and I've already waxed lyrical about why we should

2
00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.570
record as I say I think it's fantastic evidence

3
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.299
that's work being done ... both if you're trying to demonstrate to your ...

4
00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.680
whatever, your community, to your seniors, to your supervisor, to your professor or

5
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.710
whatever it is ... a video of you actually doing the work

6
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.269
really shows that you did the work ... it also

7
00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:29.340
allows others potentially to benefit from what you worked out ...

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.700
it's ... recording of a live session

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.850
I think it's not necessarily as good as ...

10
00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.399
for example a RailsCast where ... or a really highly polished

11
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.070
thing where someone is showing you step by step how to work through on something.

12
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.210
What it does ...

13
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.640
I think it's really useful to see just other people's environments; how they work

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.000
out

15
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.809
the approach that they take; their thought process ... I think it's fascinating ... I just

16
00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.129
continue to love to see

17
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:57.570
so many other people's processes ... and

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.440
it's also you know ... you may say: "Well you know the videos not much

19
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.440
benefit for me,

20
00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.140
you know I'm not going to look at it" ... if you are working with some piece of software

21
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.110
you're working with some online course that's being delivered. If you're

22
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.189
recording yourself

23
00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.570
encountering the issue that you encounter.  I mean it's just fantastic for

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.299
submitting bug reports. I mean rather than saying:

25
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.479
"You know I had this issue" and then spending fifteen-minute typing out and adding

26
00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.770
screenshots for exactly what happened and your whole

27
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.040
flow ... a short five-minute video of "I encountered this issue

28
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.369
and here's the link to the unlisted YouTube of it ...

29
00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.490
or even public YouTube if it's a public service and you're saying "Like, look

30
00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.920
you know this main thing is broken with G+" or what have you ...

31
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.530
really goes a long way. So ... you may be in the situation

32
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.590
that you can't

33
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.939
Hangout, stream, for whatever reason may be you can't get a YouTube verified account

34
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.119
maybe YouTube is banned in your country ... there are a lot of alternatives. I mean we ...

35
00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.189
I mean I'm a big fan of Hangouts mainly because

36
00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.409
its ... I don't have to then do the upload

37
00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.600
of the software. I use as I am now

38
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.130
for recording this session I'm using Screencast-O-Matic

39
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.020
... there's a free version. I'm using the pro version here which is like

40
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.790
15 dollars

41
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.200
and I've been using that ...  pretty much ...

42
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.650
I think I used to use ScreenFlow on

43
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.739
on Mac and ... yeah

44
00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.290
why did I switch to Screencast-O-Matic ...

45
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.200
I mean the ScreenFlow was Mac only ... I think the particular thing at the time

46
00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.250
ScreenFlow

47
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.220
which is a Mac system just seemed to take a lot longer to do certain sorts of

48
00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.709
things

49
00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.230
... but still I mean compared to Hangouts I mean, once I had finished recording

50
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.950
this video for you guys ... I'm gonna have to ...

51
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.180
 I've got an integrated upload to YouTube thing in here you can see the

52
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.340
last one that I just uploaded.

53
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.670
The encoding process of turning whatever format

54
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.950
Screencast-O-Matic is saving the video in to

55
00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.230
what it needs to be to be displayed on YouTube can sometimes take a long time

56
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.000
that's sometimes a big issue for me in terms of managing my day

57
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.360
so doing a hangout stream is fantastic in that like I've done the stream

58
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.540
that's it. I don't have to ... I can just "Fire-and-forget" and

59
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.000
it's up there ... but there's other issues we'll go into a minute.  So Screencast-O-Matic

60
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.650
I happen to use that ...

61
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.700
there are lots of other ones, there are lots of other platform-specifics that work

62
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.260
only on OSX, or Linux or Windows and then there's other online meeting tools which I've had

63
00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.940
some experience with and I just ... I think

64
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.180
the Google hangouts is so ...

65
00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.810
the fact that it's free and it's by Google and it works pretty

66
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:29.599
well ...

67
00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.690
I guess one key thing, if we go on to Screencast-O-Matic

68
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.780
which is as I say there's a

69
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.340
a 15-minute limit. I actually hadn't noticed the watermark but

70
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.409
that was certainly ScreeFlow's (business) model ...

71
00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:45.540
there are actually editing tool built into the pro version

72
00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.200
... you can upload directly ...

73
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.659
to YouTube. I think the particular thing that I like

74
00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:57.640
about ... for recording these ... I mean I could be recording these little lecture segments

75
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.939
on the Hangouts but

76
00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.540
you kind of have to go either showing the entire screen or showing the person's

77
00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.030
face

78
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.250
and backwards and forwards and I would much rather have ... and

79
00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.849
I think my students suggest they prefer ... I don't know

80
00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.390
the little picture in picture talking head

81
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.410
which is ... we've got to be careful with the placement of that because of ...

82
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.790
it might obscure a different part of the screen which might be important

83
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.229
but you can move that around afterwards ... yeah and it's multi-platform, so

84
00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.610
for my students ... I mean I think now I'm recommending

85
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.690
all my HPU students, and I'll be recommending all the MOOC students for ...

86
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.620
documenting their ... or your, shall we say, documenting

87
00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.050
their work ... to be using the hangouts because it's just

88
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.470
so much less time but if you're not connected to the network; if

89
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.210
you've got a very spotty network connection ... for some reason you can't use a Hangout

90
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.820
and you need to record a little simple video

91
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.340
the free version of Screencast-O-Matic is absolutely fine ...

92
00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.550
yeah so ... Mac options there's a series of things. Actually this is getting easier and

93
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:01.180
easier;

94
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.699
and the QuickTime screencasts; FaceTime ... there's a number a free

95
00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.910
options ... I think you can also, you can

96
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.699
pay for the version of iMovie. I've used iMovie to edit

97
00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.930
some things in the past ... there are converters ... I think the file format

98
00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.030
is becoming less of an issue.  It still seems to take a long ... I mean

99
00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:23.039
just the nature of the beast is that it takes a long time to convert from one file

100
00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:23.750
format

101
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.509
to another.  From my point of view, anything that instantly gets it onto YouTube and I don't

102
00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:28.860
have to think about the conversion

103
00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.110
has got to be good ... there are a number of open source clients

104
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.660
for Windows, I think there are a number of paid clients as well.  I may have used

105
00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.410
CamStudio in the past ... generally I have had

106
00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.710
a fair amount of problem ...

107
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.320
with Windows ... particularly for a game programming course where I was

108
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.710
... desperate to try and record both the audio from the games

109
00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.259
and me talking about the games as I played them and gave feedback for my

110
00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:54.919
students

111
00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.960
on the games that they'd designed. I think that might of actually been the reason that I switched to

112
00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.020
Screencast-O-Matic because Screenflow was specific to

113
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.410
the Mac and I needed to get it working on Windows

114
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.500
for the ... many of the games were Windows only ...

115
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.190
yeah ... that said I have had trouble

116
00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.789
in the past, this is another thing, on Mac with recording this

117
00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:20.110
the audio stream for both Screencast-O-Matic, sorry from both the

118
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.250
... my audio, my spoken audio and the

119
00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.580
audio that's coming out of the computer. That seems to be becoming less

120
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.960
of a problem. I guess I'm using ... Hangouts now so frequently

121
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.930
.... I did have a sort of a big set up anyway, that's sort of Mac specific and probably

122
00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:37.569
won't worry many of you but if anybody wants to chat

123
00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.289
about ... I mean I've been teaching exclusively online for about four years now;

124
00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.569
is it coming up to five? And so anybody who wants to wax lyrical with me about different

125
00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:46.449
recording options

126
00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:49.660
I'd be happy to chat. I have much less experience with Linux.

127
00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.530
I tend to record on Windows and OSX. I tend not to record

128
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.780
... in Linux ...

129
00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.039
my good friends tell me that there are ...

130
00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.419
yeah ... ffmpeg, which I think I also had a Windows version for but that ...

131
00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.740
ffmpeg is recommended. There are also some other ones

132
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.870
... as I say, I don't try and do ... I don't have so much

133
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.449
experience recording in that environment and then there's a lot of these

134
00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:13.770
different

135
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.520
online meeting systems like WebEx and GoToMeeting and TeamViewer

136
00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.720
and so on that I think some people swear by. I guess

137
00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:24.690
I'm always worried with ... I guess with any software

138
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.729
framework you're sort of worried about

139
00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:31.599
... you're going to end up paying monthly fees and is the company going to go out of business

140
00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:32.940
and so on; and one feels

141
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.229
if Google have got a free offering, I tend to go there

142
00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.949
... but yeah if people are having particularly good experiences

143
00:07:39.949 --> 00:07:43.720
with these do let me know ... well I've had some

144
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.830
bad experiences in the past although of course

145
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:48.879
... it's very impressive how so many companies

146
00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:52.169
up their game over time and the software improves over time

147
00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:55.610
so ... yeah I just ... we'll finish up there with saying

148
00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.669
record your live sessions ... I think it's really valuable

149
00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:04.030
... and there's lots of different ways to do it and

150
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:05.900
and give it a try, okay, bye for now!
