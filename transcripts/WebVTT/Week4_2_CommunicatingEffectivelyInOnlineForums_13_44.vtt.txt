00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.620
Right, so let's talk about communicating effectively in online forums, of which there are many

1
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.970
kinds.

2
00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.929
The term "Online Forum" tends to make us think of "bulletin boards" and similar systems with

3
00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.459
threaded conversations, although the term can be used to refer to pretty much anything

4
00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.699
that is not video conferencing.

5
00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.050
If we think of things in terms of that scale we were looking at last week, an online forum

6
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.480
is anything that doesn't involve real time audio or video and instead relies on text

7
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.560
and possibly embedded images and video.

8
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.360
So that's what we mean by online forums and they are, I think, extraordinarily valuable

9
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.440
for online students and for distributed teams ...

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.760
because very often you can't get together at the same time, or just bandwidth limitations

11
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.570
prevent you from doing realtime audio or visual interaction.

12
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.660
So basically, whether you're studying online or you're taking part in a distributed team,

13
00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.140
the problems are often similar.

14
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.640
You're faced with some challenge, some technology problem, or maybe it's a team organization

15
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.830
problem, that you need advice on, and so these forums can help you solve your problem.

16
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.300
The forum itself might have been created specifically for your group by your team, or have been

17
00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.190
created as a resource for students, or just been created by other people related to a

18
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.650
particular technology.

19
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.830
Either way, online forums are a great resource to help you solve all sorts of problems, as

20
00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.090
I'm sure you well know.

21
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.010
They also allow a bit of human contact which is a good thing.

22
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.350
Maybe there are some people who really don't want to interact with other people and just

23
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.350
work in isolation.

24
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.900
We did have at least one person who responded to the pair programming questionnaire a couple

25
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.330
of years ago saying "I just don't like people!"

26
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.979
So yes, right, if you really don't like interacting with people in real time, then scrums and

27
00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.030
pair-programming are definitely out for you.

28
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.799
But perhaps the interaction of an online text forum is more manageable for some.

29
00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.200
Although perhaps in extreme cases even just forum interaction might make some uncomfortable?

30
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.090
However I would argue that almost all problem-solving, particularly that related to technology, critically

31
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.000
requires contact with other members of your team.

32
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.710
Also, if you're a learner I think contact with other learners is hugely hugely valuable.

33
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.260
I think learners can often feel that they are suffering alone, stuck at the bottom of

34
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.129
a well, feeling that they are the only person who doesn't understand a particular problem

35
00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.109
and that everybody else is finding it very easy.

36
00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:16.450
I believe that if you make the right sort of contact with other learners you can very

37
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.540
often discover that you're having the same problem that a lot of other people are having

38
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.260
and you can share your frustration about that and perhaps work out a solution together.

39
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.599
Forums are also a great avenue to getting help from course staff such as a TA.

40
00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.989
Recent developments in online forums have moved towards more question and answer based

41
00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:39.340
approaches, like Quora or StackOverflow, so you get these big repositories of common questions

42
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.799
collected together.

43
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.139
The answers to common questions can then be collected and voted upon and through a process

44
00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.919
of community action the most valuable answers can rise to the top.

45
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:52.299
There's also whole communities related to particular technologies such as Linux or Ruby

46
00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.319
on Rails or whatever, that can be very very powerful engines for generating solutions.

[NEXT SLIDE]

48
00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:03.790
Now we're going to make a distinction, which you may have heard of before, between asynchronous

49
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:05.329
and synchronous forums.

50
00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.829
Asynchronous forums are these "message boards" where content is organised around posts, often

51
00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.980
in a question/answer format, e.g. Google Groups, Quora and StackOveflow

52
00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.309
Synchronous forums are also called chat, Instant Messengers, or IM for short, and they offer

53
00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:25.260
what I would call real-time text communication.

54
00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.209
You can't usually see the actual act of someone else typing letter by letter ...

55
00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.760
but most recent chat systems have an indication that another person is in the process of typing,

56
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.120
before you see their chat message.

57
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.290
This appears to be designed to help prevent people "chatting over each other" and keep

58
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.040
the conversation going.

59
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.409
The key thing however is that the text update, when it comes, is pushed up in a compact format,

60
00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:48.409
and you don't have to refresh a web browser, or make an active request in order to see

61
00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:52.769
the new message.

62
00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.549
Of course the border line between these synchronous and asynchronous forums blurs with things

63
00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:01.559
like GitHub issues and pull requests, where GitHub uses Websockets to push live updates

64
00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:02.230
to the conversation.

65
00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.469
That can be really handy, but the GitHub commenting format still looks like an asynchronous forum,

66
00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:12.909
and "chat" clients tend to be much more compact, to allow for a faster back and forth.

67
00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:18.079
Some people are not so keen on text chat interactions, but it's becoming more and more prevalent

68
00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:22.590
as more and more people are using text chat on cellphones, in websites, through apps like

69
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.430
WhatsApp, and software like Slack, which is replacing email internally in some organizations.

70
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:35.310
But so let's compare the edX forum with the Slack or Gitter chats that we also use in

71
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.909
the course.

72
00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:40.610
Here's the edX Forum with its list of topics and a single question picked out.

73
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.789
In principle, if you are refreshing the page fast enough in an asynchronous forum like

74
00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:52.210
edX or StackOverflow, then you can get an experience almost like a real-time chat, but that's rare.

75
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.389
Real-time "synchronous" chats like Gitter or Slack

76
00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.530
increase the chances that a real-time chat conversation will take place.

77
00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.030
I'm sure some people are thinking: "But, why do we have all these different alternatives?

78
00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.360
Why are we having both the embedded Gitter chat and the

79
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.770
edX forum?""

80
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.930
My answer is that they are different tools that have different values at different times.

81
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.569
Sometimes when you're trying to quickly solve a problem with somebody and they tell you

82
00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.370
something and you want to ask them a little question ...

83
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.169
if they can respond quickly you can get a productive back and forth.

84
00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.610
Sometimes you can cut through a lot of red tape if you're just both typing into a

85
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.259
real-time chat.

86
00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.919
It's a double-edged sword of course, because things can also get a lot more intense, and

87
00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.129
you have to be careful you're not overwhelming the other person.

88
00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.099
There's also visibility, so a shared chat room can allow a lot of people to quickly

89
00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:45.599
contribute to a discussion, but again that be good or bad depending on the circumstances.

90
00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.400
Another factor is that real-time chat systems don't tend to support discussion threads in

91
00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.280
the same way that asynchronous forums do rather well.

92
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.330
I'm getting ahead of myself here though ... let's list the different pros and cons to the different

93
00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.400
systems.

94
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:08.919
So returning to this asynchronous/synchronous distinction;

95
00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.490
"Asynchronous" implies that people are going to be looking at the forum at different times;

96
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.259
the forum is not designed specifically for users being online together, which means posts

97
00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.990
to the forum are coming in one after another with short breaks, in a "serial" fashion.

98
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.509
"Synchronous" implies "real time", that the various parties are at the computer interacting

99
00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:28.750
in real-time, contributing in "parallel".

100
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.879
Although, what I would point out for things like Slack and Gitter is that one can slide

101
00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:36.370
backwards and forwards between a synchronous and an asynchronous conversation.

102
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.520
Particularly if you've got a relatively inactive chat channel, you can leave a post in there

103
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.319
and someone might not see it for an hour and then they would respond and then you might

104
00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.939
have an asynchronous discussion in the "real-time" chat over the course of a day or two.

105
00:06:49.939 --> 00:06:52.879
Then suddenly you're online together and it becomes synchronous.

106
00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:57.639
Anyway I think the ability to slide backwards and forwards between those two states is potentially

107
00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:00.740
a very valuable aspect of a text chat.

108
00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.419
Asynchronous systems tend to have better persistence, with many chat systems having a limited history

109
00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:10.629
or visibility as regards previous chat messages.

110
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:14.759
Asynchronous forums likely encourage a broader participation, with it being easier to branch

111
00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.930
off into a different thread.

112
00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.999
Whereas it's more complicated to refer back to older chats in synchronous forums, in some

113
00:07:20.999 --> 00:07:24.639
cases limiting the interaction to the currently active participants.

114
00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:30.370
Probably one of the key things to consider is the length of your post to different forums.

115
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:34.159
In general the greater the length of the thing you post the fewer people who are going to

116
00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:36.009
have time to read it.

117
00:07:36.009 --> 00:07:40.169
Now you might have a lot to say, and if you need to rant and brain-dump, then that's fine.

118
00:07:40.169 --> 00:07:43.919
However in general I would say longer posts should go into asynchronous forums where people

119
00:07:43.919 --> 00:07:46.169
will have more time to review them.

120
00:07:46.169 --> 00:07:50.289
Even then you will do yourself a huge favour in terms of getting your message across if

121
00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:53.270
you edit your post to be as short as possible.

122
00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.830
In real-time chat you should prefer to make your posts as short as you can, almost as

123
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:59.080
if you were speaking to somebody.

124
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.919
You know that glazed look that people can get if you speak for too long? People will

125
00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.110
just switch off, and potentially get irritated, so its important to keep your real-time chat

126
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.499
posts short and to the point.

127
00:08:09.499 --> 00:08:13.249
If you have eight questions, that's great, write them all down somewhere safe, and then

128
00:08:13.249 --> 00:08:15.289
post just the most important one.

129
00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:19.849
Then ask the other questions as the opportunities arise, rather than posting a whole wall of

130
00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:21.379
text into the chat.

131
00:08:21.379 --> 00:08:25.710
Some people might say: "Well you know, I've got a lot to say. I need to be able to say

132
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.169
it all."

133
00:08:26.169 --> 00:08:30.449
Well ultimately it's your choice, but my recommendation is that you think carefully about the impact

134
00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:31.770
your posts have on other people.

135
00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.010
Lots of people are very busy ...

136
00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.840
Many of us have got a lot of commitments, such as work, family (kids or elderly relatives)

137
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.419
making ends meet and so on.

138
00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:43.400
You might say, "I don't have time to edit down all my thoughts", which may be true,

139
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:46.520
but if so you're pushing the editing work onto others.

140
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.700
Others might not have time to both edit your thoughts and then also respond to them.

141
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.160
If the complex thought you are having really requires saying a lot of things then that's

142
00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.230
also a good time to consider posting to an asynchronous forum where you're putting less

143
00:08:57.230 --> 00:09:00.130
pressure on others to read what you say.

144
00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.640
If you're worried that you haven't received a reply on your asynchronous forum submission,

145
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:06.450
then post a link to it into the real-time chat.

146
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:11.390
I think that's a very powerful combination. Bringing up an issue in text chat, but adding

147
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:14.480
a link to more details for those who are interested.

148
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.950
If it's really really long, even for a forum post, then how about writing a blog post?

149
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:23.570
Then you can post the link to the blog to any of the forums, chat, bulletin boards or

150
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.070
what have you.

151
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.450
There's also the question of back and forth.

152
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.120
Text chat is set up to allow a quick back and forth, but even with short posts you can

153
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:34.640
end up overwhelming someone if you persist in a line of questioning or debate past a

154
00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.270
certain point.

155
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:39.200
I've got more to say about this, but perhaps I'll follow my own advice and direct you to

156
00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.640
a blog post I wrote on the subject :-)

157
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:51.060
Coming back to the slide; it will depend on who's around but you can get a much faster

158
00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.520
response in a chat environment.

159
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:57.060
What I would really strongly recommend is asking questions in group channels rather

160
00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.150
than to individuals.

161
00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.430
I get a lot of people contacting me individually with questions like "Oh what do you think

162
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.410
of this new technology, or this new course", which I'd really much rather respond to in

163
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.360
a group chat, rather than a direct message or DM.

164
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.330
It's partly that with hundreds of TAs and thousands of students it's hard for me to

165
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:14.770
respond individually.

166
00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:19.440
Also, if you're DMing me then you have to wait until I am free to answer your question.

167
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.860
If you ask in a group chat or forum, then potentially you get an answer faster, because

168
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:25.640
someone else can respond before me.

169
00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.810
Please don't ever ask "Can I ask you a question?"

170
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:32.000
That just guarantees that it will take longer to get your answer.

171
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.420
I will always say, "Yes, you can ask me a question."

172
00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.240
However I do really prefer that if it's not a life and death personal matter that you

173
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.450
ask in a group channel or forum because 1. you'll get an answer faster, and 2. others

174
00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:46.080
may benefit from seeing the conversation.

175
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:50.290
I get the sense that many people are embarrassed to ask questions in group channels.

176
00:10:50.290 --> 00:10:53.870
They don't want to bother other people, or they don't want to look like they don't know

177
00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:54.180
something.

178
00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.560
I strongly believe that one of the most important things in learning is to be able to admit

179
00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.460
in front of others that you don't know something.

180
00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.680
It is okay not to know things, or to be unsure; and it's by having a conversation in a group

181
00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.830
where we all admit to not knowing things that we can become a powerful learning team.

182
00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:13.970
When answers then get shared with multiple people, this is part of succeeding as a distributed

183
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:15.560
team.

184
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.550
Another distinguishing feature is that historically it's generally been the case that asynchronous

185
00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.440
forums are not so easily searchable.

186
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.910
However Slack has gone a long way to change this by providing good search functionality

187
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:26.660
in their chat client.

188
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.230
So maybe asynchronous forums are better when you need to describe a longer more complex

189
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.190
problem and synchronous forums are better for clarification and simple guidance?

190
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:38.500
Both kinds of forums can be very powerful support for problem solving, but both should

191
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.020
be used carefully.

192
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:44.200
Clumsy use of either can sometimes draw out an issue which might be more quickly resolved

193
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.940
in a real-time Hangout with screen share; or perhaps just have been better left alone

194
00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.410
or solved individually.

195
00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:53.820
My rule of thumb is struggle by yourself for 20 minutes - and then if you're making no

196
00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:56.440
progress at all it's time to look for help.

197
00:11:56.440 --> 00:12:02.180
So then are you looking for support in chat? In a Q&A forum or in a real-time Hangout?

198
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:08.470
One disadvantage to the community of real-time A/V interaction is that the history of

199
00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.670
it is not text searchable in the same way as chats and posts.

200
00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:16.330
But sometimes an interactive video where a person is saying: "Oh I'm clicking here and

201
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.480
I'm doing this" ...

202
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.590
And then we're like "Oh of course, the thing we've been talking about for the last few

203
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:25.850
hours" in a real-time chat or asynchronous forum suddenly becomes transparent.

204
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.550
So in summary all of these different tools have a valuable role to play, and the trick

205
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:31.160
is to learn when to use which.

206
00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.350
Where we want to be is a place in which we are choosing the best tool for the job, i.e.

207
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:41.230
is this a problem for an asynchronous forum, or a real time chat, or for a live audio/visual

208
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:44.800
stream like a Google Hangout.

209
00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:52.450
So there's lots of free chat options if you're setting up your own distributed team.

210
00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:55.320
In the past we went with a combination of Skype and IRC.

211
00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.700
However in AgileVentures we've now switched completely to Slack, and in edX we've switched

212
00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:01.010
to Gitter;

213
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:04.890
We're using the free tiers of these systems, which require payment to unlock more resources,

214
00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.040
such as history, or number of team members.

215
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.740
The key thing here is the way in which the user interfaces of systems like Slack and

216
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:16.830
Gitter are starting to outpace what's on offer from other free and open source solutions.

217
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:20.570
We use Gitter in the MOOC specifically because it is embeddable and thus easily discoverable

218
00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.010
by students without having to go through an invite process.

219
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.640
So in summary I'd strongly recommend you experiment with the free tiers of systems like Slack

220
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:31.850
and Gitter, which also provide lots of great integrations with code versioning and continuous

221
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:36.570
integration systems so your team can keep up to date with your code and its deployment.

222
00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:41.890
If you ask me in the AgileVentures slack chat I'll be happy to show you some examples.
