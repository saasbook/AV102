Hey there. Yeah so time to wrap this course up with a final word on the edX

1
00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:15.500
forum. Let's go into screen share and have a little look at what's going on with that ... boom boom boom boom boom!

2
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.960
... yeah so as I mentioned before in the past we've used ... well, back in the day it was

3
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.269
edX forum, we .. there was actually ... gosh there's been all sorts of experimental forums, over the

4
00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:34.359
years but I think we're coming back to using the edX forum now and that's one of the main ways that

5
00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:42.600
students are going to use to communicate with us about the MOOC. If we go to ... this is the ... of course our AV102

6
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.219
course - we can see the discussion link ... we've also got the live chat. Both of these things

7
00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.670
we'll have pretty much set up identically on the MOOC which I will give access to you soon so you can see all

8
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.249
of that. We've got there, that's a discussion for us and then we got Gitter embedded there

9
00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:04.379
as the live chat so for the students if they want to do live chat it's going to be

10
00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.470
Gitter rather than Slack but we will use the Slack IM to coordinate our activities as

11
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.450
TA's on the course

12
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.430
... pretty much the key thing for the MOOC going forward is that the forum

13
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.299
needs ongoing monitoring ... so students will come in with questions

14
00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.990
and so on and so one of the key things that the teaching assistants, the TAs, the

15
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:36.119
world TA's, do is respond to those and help basically make sure that the whole

16
00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.000
process goes off smoothly and of course it's a worldwide course; there are people posting

17
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.680
questions at all times of day or night and we want to have all of the

18
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.829
students get ... not necessarily immediate answers to the questions because

19
00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.680
sometimes you need to ask the question and think it over and so on; but if people are really

20
00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.500
stuck we want to support them in whichever way we can. Now in the past we've been trying to schedule

21
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.969
people around the world.  We've had all different kind of spreadsheets for people to say

22
00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.380
this is what I'm going to do, this is when I'm going to do it.

23
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.120
I think it's ... just it's all been a bit higgledy-piggledy ... what I'm going to recommend and I think

24
00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.250
is the best is letting people know that in the Slack that you're in the

25
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.930
process of checking. We'll also have a Wiki, in the course, you'll see there'll be weekly assignments coming up

26
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.950
well not assignments, there'll be weekly, in this same AV102 you'll be able to post the activities that you've

27
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.970
done ... more on that in a minute ... but yeah what I would really say and I'll turn Slack on again ... what I would say is the key

28
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.670
thing to do, is if you are going to come on the sites and you're gonna have a look through and

29
00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.130
see if there are any questions that need answering then what I'd recommend that you do is

30
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.690
you come into our AV102 chat room and you do a little message a bit like this, it's taking

31
00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.660
a little while

32
00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:05.360
for AV102 to load up because AgileVentures is the third of the seven Slacks that I have

33
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.510
available.  Here we go and it's telling me to keep hydrated and not forget to stretch, but anyways so ... I'll just put like

34
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:18.410
testing in but ... what I would say is that when you're coming ... logging on to do a bit of TA

35
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.840
activity is basically come in here and say ... you can actually do

36
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:32.570
this me thing here and say: "is currently checking the MOOC forums" like

37
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.320
this ... and then you go and do you stuff and maybe you're checking that for

38
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.450
half an hour and answering some questions or whatever and you could then do ... once you've

39
00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.459
done that and maybe ... as a result of the thing ... you've answered

40
00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.850
a few questions and then you've found oh, okay right actually there's this one

41
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.090
question maybe you need to escalate it, maybe there's a problem that you can't resolve; you'd like

42
00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.240
to get other input in and you'd say: "hey channel!" I won't do channel here, or

43
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.830
... you can be notifying to my attention or what have you; you can say: "hey guys"

44
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:14.580
(I'm going to put TEST in the front there, you don't have to do that obviously) ... "hey guys any thoughts

45
00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:22.930
on this?" and that way potentially rather than you DMing me

46
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.520
individually ... everybody can sort of pile in on that and offer

47
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.220
their help and support and advice and come in and ask questions and then when you -

48
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.260
when you - when you're done, it's like

49
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:43.730
ok spent half an hour to an hour doing this and the other is now signing off from checking

50
00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:49.820
the MOOC forums and I think the advantage is that ... what

51
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.230
frustrates some people is that there'll be this big wall of questions going

52
00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.890
on but then sometimes there'll be somebody there who is working really hard answering them all and then

53
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:05.280
you'll come on and you'll say right I'm going to do an hour now and you'll look through and you'll see everything's answered and there's nothing for you to do and if you

54
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.450
are monitoring the Slack here and you can check here what's happening with

55
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:15.190
"Ah, ok" you can see that ... "Ah, oh at the moment actually there's already

56
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:21.870
three guys checking the forum, we don't need to." ... this is a nice way to

57
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.810
coordinate. We'll also have ... there's a Wiki as well and we'll set it up for people to

58
00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:38.690
like ... gosh, that's looking a bit ugly isn't it ... but we'll set ... I guess this is yeah ... anyway.

59
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.330
We'll add some space in there for people to say this is my preferred time and so on and we'll just

60
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:47.980
see how to coordinate. It's still experimental, is there a better

61
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:53.960
solution for this?  For a big crowd of distributed volunteers to support the

62
00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.460
students? Do let me know; you have my attention through this slack channel and ...

63
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.729
we'll keep refining. I mean it's ... the key thing here is that ...

64
00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.870
we're all volunteers here. We're trying to make the world a better place; bring education to

65
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:13.960
the masses

66
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.740
... the process of the MOOC from Armando and Dave at Berkeley has been a

67
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.070
succession of refinements.

68
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:31.850
Let's use the team process here and we've got this Pivotal Tracker here. I

69
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.940
will start filling this with things related to the movie MOOC ... probably

70
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.320
this time next week.

71
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:49.350
Yes, I think we have got ... at least the MOOC goes live in about two weeks and so I'll try and get you all early access to that and we can hopefully

72
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.590
use this board to coordinate work we're doing on the MOOC, but

73
00:06:54.430 --> 00:07:00.100
yeah I mean in some ways I think that kind of the first line for coordination for all of us is the

74
00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:05.870
AV102 distributed teams Slack there. So in principle once you finish the

75
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:12.970
assignments for this week, you will have earned the TA level 1, woohoo! And we will get those out to you.

76
00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.210
Apologies again if that gets delayed. We'll fire up the ... there's a series of squirrels that stamp things

77
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:24.590
on each other and we'll get you that level one certificate ... but you may then be interested in getting the level 2 certificate, and

78
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:31.920
so in order to do that we'll give you beta access to the MOOC and we'd like you

79
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.650
to basically be in a position to review the week's material for the MOOC before it goes out to

80
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.820
the main MOOC, which I think it serves two purposes, one: is it's great for you to be reviewing in advance of helping

81
00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:48.200
other students because if you've got it all fresh in your mind that's really really valuable and then the other thing is

82
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.950
rather than us putting out material to 10s of thousands of students and there being some sort

83
00:07:53.950 --> 00:08:02.540
of - issues ... if you can catch those first then we can get them all fixed up then that will save a lot of confusion on the part of the students and so in

84
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:08.460
order to get the TA level two certificate you need to do each week one of the following

85
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:16.970
that's either respond to a student in a forum and that could either be ... and that should be edX chat or forum there so either

86
00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:24.470
you could be responding to a student in the saasbook MOOC Gitter or in the ...

87
00:08:25.569 --> 00:08:35.639
it's late here, excuse me, in the discussion for the MOOC.  One of the assignments this week is to practice using the

88
00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:37.159
functionality here in the discussion

89
00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:42.490
... you can read through the different features there to follow the posts

90
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.459
and get email updates and so on and so forth. So do have a look through information on

91
00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:53.360
how to use the forum or potentially maybe ...

92
00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.949
you're not so big on typing things out. You'd like to actually help some students do some

93
00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:02.970
pairing, so that would be an equally valuable thing to do and basically ...

94
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:09.300
whichever of these you choose to do ... and yes and actually there's also reporting an issue in the tracker;

95
00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.029
basically each of these things will generate a link. So they'll be a link to your

96
00:09:13.029 --> 00:09:18.870
chat message or your forum post; there'll be a link to the issue you've recorded in the tracker or there'll be a link

97
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.819
to the video session where you helped some other students pair on

98
00:09:23.819 --> 00:09:29.360
some aspect of the course and basically so week by week in the AV102

99
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:38.720
course that's going forward you'll see ... going into the courseware ... basically, if have my view here, basically

100
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:45.339
there is a series of level 2 certificate TA and project tracks going forward and so each week

101
00:09:45.339 --> 00:09:49.230
these'll get released and you'll be able to demonstrate what you've done and post that

102
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:55.360
into there and it goes on to level two. There, thats the end of the first part of the MOOC and you can get your level two certificate and then

103
00:09:55.360 --> 00:10:01.089
similarly with the level 3 certificate there, doing it with the second part of the MOOC. Now you may say

104
00:10:01.089 --> 00:10:07.009
well I'm all very interested in distributed teams, I'm not so interested in helping the students in the

105
00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:11.100
MOOC and you can still get these level 2 and level 3 certificates. We have a

106
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:17.480
project track as an alternative if you are interested in continuing to developing your distributed team

107
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:22.480
skills and working with us at AgileVentures then there is a kind of

108
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.709
parallel track going on here where basically you can submit a bit of work that you've done

109
00:10:27.709 --> 00:10:33.680
in a distributed project each week and still get these certificates. There we go yeah

110
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:39.020
these will be ... that's basically the key thing; its the TA training course, the AV102

111
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:43.150
... you'll keep submitting those things and be able to get those

112
00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:49.180
certificates and I just want to say thanks so much for taking part in the

113
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.540
course with us

114
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:56.770
my apologies that we don't have huge resources to throw into it ...

115
00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:01.450
we're sort of running things ... group of volunteers, bit of a shoestring ... I hope

116
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:07.800
there was great stuff of value in there. My apologies for any speed bumps

117
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.670
as it were, like we've got some of the old videos may be referring to

118
00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.000
to Skype and to the Stack Exchange. Hopefully on the next run we'll

119
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.660
have the time and resources to completely update those. I do hope you enjoy

120
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.070
the assignments. I very much enjoyed meeting many of you in the

121
00:11:24.070 --> 00:11:28.910
forums and in the Google Hangouts during the past week and look forward to meeting

122
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:31.790
you again and either way

123
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.390
best of luck in your future endeavours I hope whether we meet again or not

124
00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:44.840
you get something of value from here and you find that useful in your ongoing connection with other people in

125
00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.420
the world

126
00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.800
and trying to make the world a better place, because that's what it's all about. Alright bye for now.
