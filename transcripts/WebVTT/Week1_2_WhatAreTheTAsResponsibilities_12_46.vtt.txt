00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.820
So what are the TA's responsibilities?

1
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.969
We've developed a TA's Creed, which you should know if you're going to be a TA.

2
00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.530
First, you need to be responsible.

3
00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.809
If there's a problem you need to pass it up through the chain of command so that it can

4
00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:17.180
be addressed rather than forgotten.

5
00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.150
Also you need to be respectful to the students who are struggling away with the sometimes

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.939
difficult and challenging material.

7
00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.070
A student might be struggling with something you find easy, but its unhelpful to imply

8
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.669
that things "should be easy" or that a student "should know" something.

9
00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.270
You need to have empathy for the different learning journey that every student is on.

10
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.090
Further, you'll need to be relevant, informative and resourceful.

11
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880
This means staying "on topic".

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.110
Students will get stuck in this real-world software; and they'll get stuck down all different

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.510
sorts of alleyways to do with version issues and libraries and so on.

14
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.980
You'll need to be resourceful think on your feet, and get the right sorts of information

15
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.260
to the right people at the right time.

16
00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.060
One of the key things really is to be actively engaged with the courseware.

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.500
Particularly if you took the 169 course some time ago then you may not have the assignments

18
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.810
and the aspects of it in the forefront of your mind.

19
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.119
Ideally you need to be working through the courseware with the students so that you've

20
00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.469
looked at the assignment and just completed it, i.e. the one they've been working on that

21
00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.929
week.

22
00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:18.549
You also need to be a facilitator.

23
00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.969
Which means that rather than just solving problems, you need to help other people solve

24
00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:29.219
their own problems - and we'll talk more about this as we go on in this next section.

25
00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.460
In terms of supporting students what we really want is the students to become more and more

26
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.270
independent of the TA's and the instructors and so on.

27
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.340
We want the students to become independent learners.

28
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.649
As much as possible we would like to help them discover the answers by themselves.

29
00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429
Rather than just saying: "this is how you do it, and then you do this, and then you

30
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.850
do this", we need to provide a scaffolding.

31
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.649
A scaffolding that is about helping them learn to discover the answers by themselves.

32
00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.939
We'll get into that in more detail in a minute.

33
00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.060
Another key thing is helping them get past needless roadblocks to learning.

34
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.929
For example say the student is stuck because of a version issue.

35
00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.580
There is a judgement call here about whether we just give the answer to that particular

36
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.530
fix that so that we can focus on a higher-level software engineering issue ...

37
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.860
Or is it actually that this versioning or library issue is something that they could

38
00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
solve by themselves through a process of exploration?

39
00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.920
And making the right decision is tricky, and requires intuition that you will need to develop

40
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.810
over time.

41
00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.140
It's good to be aware that there are two sides to every problem. Some may just need to be fixed

42
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.920
if the learner is too stressed, and if the problem is not related to the current learning

43
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.940
objective.

44
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.110
However other problems can be used as a springboard for learning, and helping a student become

45
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.110
an independent learner.

46
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.340
Naturally providing correct, relevant, and clear information is absolutely essential.

47
00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.680
Furthermore we also want to maintain a culture of collaboration, because a positive process

48
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.690
of collaboration is fun and helps people learn.

49
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.470
So it's essential that we support the students in helping each other, by encouraging students

50
00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.200
talking to each other about challenges and so on.

51
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.670
We definitely want to get as much of that as we possibly can.

52
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.080
So there's a number of different forums where students will be communicating with each other.

53
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.190
We've got an asynchronous bulletin board in the form ofthe edX forum.

54
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.160
We've also got live realtime chat, that is embedded into the HTML of the site - that's

55
00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.000
using Gitter: a GitHub-based chat client.

56
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.150
The key thing in any of these forums is to maintain civility, we're all professionals,

57
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.280
we're all adults.

58
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.350
There's no reason not be polite to each other.

59
00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:32.650
We're all trying to work together to try and improve our knowledge and understanding of

60
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.710
all the materials.

61
00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.460
So let's be civil.

62
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.680
We also suggest cutting off unproductive discussions.

63
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.110
That's again a judgement call about what is a productive or unproductive discussion.

64
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.680
I think a light touch is generally the way to go but if things really are descending

65
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.000
into less than civil tones or getting widely off topic them that's a good time to try to

66
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.260
wrap that discussion up.

67
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.460
A warning sign is when two parties are just repeatedly saying the same thing over and

68
00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:01.850
over, or the debate is going far beyond the sensible "agree to disagree" end point.

69
00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.260
Also important is being helpful without just giving the complete solution.

70
00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.470
For example someone could say "I'm stuck on homework two" and you say could right "Ah

71
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.650
here is the entire solution for homework two" which is arguably "helpful" from one point

72
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.499
of view but it's not necessarily helping the student master the material.

73
00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:21.219
So try and and be helpful without giving away the solution.

74
00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.990
It's also valuable to keep the different threads and the discussions on-topic.

75
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.770
Really try and make all the forums and the chats a place that students can enjoy going

76
00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.930
to for discussing the class topics.

77
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.659
We all want to have fun, so that's key :-)

78
00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:41.900
Now let's talk about this scaffolding concept which you may or may not be familiar with.

79
00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.259
There's this idea of instructional scaffolding which as I've alluded to already, is about

80
00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.080
giving them more "temporary" support, and not just giving a complete solution.

81
00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.800
Just sort of helping them a little bit.

82
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.110
A trivial example might be that, say you were learning a new language and you're trying

83
00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.349
to remember the translation of a word and somebody gives you the first letter of the

84
00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:03.499
word, instead of the whole word.

85
00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:07.449
There's evidence to show that if you can then correctly recall the answer, that this partial

86
00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.639
"scaffolding" will help you recall the same word yourself more easily next time around.

87
00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.289
So that intervention is a "scaffold".

88
00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.740
You're not telling the learner the complete answer or walking them step-by-step through

89
00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.789
the task.

90
00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:23.779
You're helping them figure out how to do the task on their own.

91
00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.909
It's about rather than just "give an answer" to what the students ask for; it's about helping

92
00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:31.909
them think for themselves by asking questions.

93
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.550
The other implication of it being scaffolding is also that it can be gradually removed over

94
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:36.229
time.

95
00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.849
So as time goes by so you can gradually give less support.

96
00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:44.210
You don't necessarily have to be involved personally in removing that support.

97
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.539
Your ongoing involvement with an individual learner will depend on the extent to which

98
00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:51.879
you re-interact with different students as the course goes on and in a course as large

99
00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.969
as this maybe you won't interact with the same student again, but then again ...

100
00:05:56.969 --> 00:06:01.770
However, the idea of the scaffolding is at least it's there for support at the beginning

101
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.759
and then ultimately by the time the students graduate the course they don't need that scaffolding

102
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:07.599
anymore and they can get on by themselves.

103
00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.460
I want to give a quick example with Ruby.

104
00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.159
Over here I've got the command line and this is sort of a trivial example here but let's

105
00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:35.909
say that we've defined some method in Ruby like so

106
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:48.620
And a student has unwittingly made a call to that method like this

107
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.029
and they're saying "hey look, I'm getting an error, I don't know what's going on"

108
00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:56.360
Now if you know Ruby reasonably well this will seem pretty simple and you might be tempted

109
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.289
to say: "oh yes I know exactly what the problem is"

110
00:06:59.289 --> 00:07:26.550
And you might be tempted to just to tell the student the fix. You could just say "oh right you

111
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.800
need to redefine the method with some arguments" and you could just give them the solution.

112
00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:36.550
A more scaffold-based approach would be to start asking some questions like: "okay so

113
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.710
... what are you actually trying to achieve here, what's the high-level goal?" which might

114
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.789
seem odd in this simple example, but becomes more important as things get complex.

115
00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:49.990
And then you say "so does any part of the error message make sense to you?"

116
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.889
And depending on what they say you direct them to the part of the error message that

117
00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:59.499
says "ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments" and ask "does that mean anything to you?"

118
00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:03.550
So rather than saying explicitly "you need to add arguments to your method definition",

119
00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:06.400
you can be asking if the student knows what an argument is.

120
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.990
Or better yet, waiting for them to ask you what an argument is.

121
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.020
Maybe the student has already carefully read the error message and they've just no idea

122
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.889
what arguments are.

123
00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.900
So then you can say "well arguments are things that you pass to a method" and maybe show

124
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.300
some examples and then say "there's the wrong number of them in this case".

125
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:28.759
As before this is a judgment call about at what point to intervene with what question

126
00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:30.289
or information.

127
00:08:30.289 --> 00:08:31.949
How much scaffolding should we give?

128
00:08:31.949 --> 00:08:37.240
I mean it can be frustrating for the student if it seems like you're asking too many questions.

129
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.839
It is something that you have to build up an intuition for over time.

130
00:08:40.839 --> 00:08:44.370
Note that this is also the same sort of support that a senior developer might give to a junior

131
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.860
developer in order to help them grow as a developer.

132
00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.250
Although in a project with a paying client you've got to balance what's best for learning

133
00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.670
against what's best for delivering the product on time.

134
00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:57.970
Anyhow, you can also read lots of materials online.

135
00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:03.190
We'll post some links for other reading on this topic on instructional scaffolding.

136
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:07.860
In summary, rather than just providing answers you want to help pose questions to the learner

137
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:11.410
that allows them to discover the solution in their own way.

138
00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.980
Error messages in a new language can seem very intimidating and we want to help students

139
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.420
gain confidence in navigating them.

140
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.699
So that next time they have a better chance of solving a similar, or even a more difficult,

141
00:09:20.699 --> 00:09:26.980
problem without any support.

142
00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:30.820
Also you'll need to know how to connect with the team and there's certain critical things

143
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:31.220
to do.

144
00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:35.370
Such as checking into and out-of the AV102 Slack chat.

145
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.779
We have a chat room in Slack so as you come online (and you should post and let us know

146
00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:44.769
"I'm going to be checking the forums" or "I'm going to be hanging out in the Gitter chat")

147
00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:48.560
So that you check in and when you've finished answering student questions or what have you, then you

148
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.730
check out in the Slack chat saying "I'm finishing up for now"

149
00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:56.570
This is really all about announcing that you're on-duty because we'll have 200+ TAs and if

150
00:09:56.570 --> 00:10:00.649
all them are on duty in the same two hour period then that's not a very effective way

151
00:10:00.649 --> 00:10:03.000
of serving the many thousands of students.

152
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.800
So we want to have a mechanism whereby we let each other know when we're working so

153
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.540
that as we're checking in we can tell if lots of other people are already active in the

154
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:11.389
forums and chat.

155
00:10:11.389 --> 00:10:15.360
And if they are you can say to yourself "Oh I'll come back in a couple hours instead and

156
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.620
try and contribute then"

157
00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:21.449
You'll also want to mention in the AV102 Slack chat when you're addressing a students' question,

158
00:10:21.449 --> 00:10:23.730
by posting a link to that question.

159
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.829
That will help avoid many TAs trying to answer the same question at the same time independently;

160
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:40.490
and draw them together in slack to collaborate on an answer if necessary.

161
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.630
Another thing that we're keen for you to do is to encourage the students to pair program

162
00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:44.779
with each other.

163
00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:48.220
As in previous versions of the course we have a framework for students to do pair programming

164
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:48.819
together.

165
00:10:48.819 --> 00:10:51.819
One of the key bits of feedback that we've received is that it's sometimes difficult

166
00:10:51.819 --> 00:10:53.880
for students to get themselves started.

167
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.420
So we're really keen to have TA's help students get started with pair programming:

168
00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.440
Starting a session, for example, if you've got too many students in the same session

169
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.519
you might encourage them to split off into pairs who are working on the same parts of

170
00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:05.920
the same homeworks and so on.

171
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:09.630
Also you should ensure that they aren't just posting complete solutions, or taking copies

172
00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:13.350
of solutions if they've just joined the end of a pairing session.

173
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.339
One of the best ways you can help here is ensuring that you've done as much pair programming

174
00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:20.139
yourself as possible, and sharing tips on what you find helps remote pairing work well

175
00:11:20.139 --> 00:11:24.670
for you.

176
00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:27.430
Of course one of the most critical things is to be engaged.

177
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.720
I think if you really want to help students you probably want to actually re-do the assignments

178
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:35.339
the week before the students do them; ideally pairing on them if at all possible :-)

179
00:11:35.339 --> 00:11:40.329
I will give everyone, i.e. all the TA's, beta access to the course.

180
00:11:40.329 --> 00:11:43.639
That will mean you'll be able to see the course materials a week in advance.

181
00:11:43.639 --> 00:11:47.029
I think one of the best ways to give the most effective help to the students is if you do

182
00:11:47.029 --> 00:11:51.569
the homeworks early in the week and then they will be in the forefront of your mind.

183
00:11:51.569 --> 00:11:54.790
Also if you're doing the homeworks in advance you can submit them early to help us check

184
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.120
the auto grader operation.

185
00:11:56.120 --> 00:12:01.720
We'll give you access to pivotal tracker to report and bugs or issues that arise.

186
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:05.399
Also if we've got critical errors such as the student Gitter chat is not working or

187
00:12:05.399 --> 00:12:09.329
the auto graders are not working or anything then please escalate it by posting links to

188
00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:14.660
the tracker ticket into the AV102 slack chat by typing @tansaku.

189
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:18.540
Which will alert me, Sam Joseph, which is where the buck stops here with making all

190
00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:20.290
these things work :-)

191
00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.009
Note that this is also an important part of working in a distributed team which is reporting

192
00:12:24.009 --> 00:12:28.139
errors through an issues tracking system such as Pivotal Tracker and then including the

193
00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:33.069
URL to that issue in digital communication like chat and email etc.

194
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:36.860
This is essential to ensure that everybody working on a given problem has access to all

195
00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.519
the relevant information, and that we don't waste time or overwhelm people by giving the

196
00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:42.139
same information over and over :-)
