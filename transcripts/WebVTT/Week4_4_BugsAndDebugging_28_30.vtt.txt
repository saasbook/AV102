00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.900
Hey so let's talk about bugs and debugging ... bugs

1
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:08.450
happen. They do; and sometimes they're very worrying ...

2
00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.660
why do bugs happen? I guess there's this phrase

3
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.180
human error ... we humans

4
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.699
we don't always respect exactly the logic or the syntax

5
00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.070
of the computer system we're working with ...

6
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.460
although I would say in some ways

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.730
... if ... in the ideal world

8
00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.760
we as humans could just carry on behaving in the way that we like behaving

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.940
maybe irrationally, illogically, what have you and

10
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.230
the systems we are working with would just ... would

11
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.469
interpret that ... unfortunately

12
00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.410
our computers are still distinguishable from magic and they can't

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.160
quite interpret what we want and so they have these ... rules, logic

14
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.320
syntax that we

15
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.809
kind of ... if we want to get them to do something we have to kind of -

16
00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.030
if we want get them to do the thing that we want them to do

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.469
we have to sort of end up respecting those so ... we're gonna make

18
00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:04.100
slips

19
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.030
where we fail annoyingly to match the logic or the syntax

20
00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.340
... of those systems ...

21
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.760
other things might be going on the background. There might be a change in

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.460
environment

23
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.590
yeah ... your operating system is upgraded

24
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.280
... configuration is changed. I mean this is why

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.549
we release the virtual machine it's to try and have a single

26
00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.659
stable environment for everybody to work on, single configuration

27
00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.790
but we use a tool like bundle to manage all the gems

28
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.130
for the

29
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.650
different software libraries that are needed to do all the different bits and pieces

30
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.780
and this ... in some ways ...

31
00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.880
... the programming and even the testing bit

32
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.049
and even the BDD and so on; it's all relatively straightforward

33
00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:54.619
sometimes compared to trying to manage issues that kind of come up in the environment or the

34
00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.479
configuration

35
00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.049
and so on ... and sometimes it's just a difference in -

36
00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.509
in perspective ... you just ...

37
00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.509
there's bug at the software level, there's bugs at the interface level;

38
00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.830
is it just that you thought something was going to work this way and

39
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.989
it actually it should work that way ... I mean just

40
00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.160
stuff happens ... I've got a few slides here that are mainly focused on

41
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.680
kind of bugs from the software perspective and I mean this is - this is generally also it's ...

42
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.670
we're following

43
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.080
from the textbook ... there's a great section

44
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.260
... which I've just got over here ...

45
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.959
which I think is, is it 4.7? Oh, where's that table of contents - it's

46
00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.250
four-point five: debugging when things the wrong

47
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.849
I think almost could be broken out into its own chapter ... in some ways

48
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.910
this is the key thing about ... dealing with technology being a

49
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.620
software engineer

50
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.670
is about your process that you use

51
00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.900
when you encounter an issue; whether it's an interface issue or a software

52
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.040
bug ... there's a - something is broken (or test is failing).

53
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.290
And the key thing is

54
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.790
as Douglas Adams would say is just "Don't panic!" Really, ...

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.159
and of course it's difficult when there's a deadline and there's eight other team-members saying "we must have this now!" "We must

56
00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.930
have it now

57
00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.840
now now!" ... it's challenging ... we have

58
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.040
... we all have at any given time a model in our mind of how

59
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.250
the technology we're using is working and have expectations and when

60
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.780
things are different from those expectations it's like Errrrrrr

61
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.599
and the key thing, assuming that you're getting some sort of error message,

62
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.920
is to read that error message ... sometimes that error message might not

63
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.370
have the information in it that you need sometimes ... there's no

64
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.989
guarantee but do

65
00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.110
read it ... I mean it's the kind of thing ... you can get thrown off track of course

66
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.659
... the error messages are also something that are designed

67
00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.659
to a degree by the developers of the system

68
00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.000
developers of the systems whether it's a website, a web app,

69
00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.590
a programming language a compiler whatever it happens to be; they're

70
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.720
doing their best.  There's often

71
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.110
we get frustrated with ... computer systems

72
00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.560
whether ... technologies because they don't ... it's like

73
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.590
"Ooh the person who designed this! They're not seeing

74
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.360
things from my perspective!" No, I mean ... they were doing their best

75
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.319
... I think

76
00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.879
... other things being equal shall we assume that they were doing

77
00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.880
their best? They maybe ... not being omniscient, as developers are not,

78
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.479
didn't necessarily see precisely the way that you were

79
00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.710
expecting to use the technology, or maybe they did, and just other things have changed and they

80
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.009
haven't worked out how to get the error messages

81
00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.360
to ... be as comprehensible as they could be

82
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.960
although I say I think there's a tendency, at least I have from - from using Ruby and Cucumber,

83
00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.990
I think the error messages are getting more helpful over time

84
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.479
rather than just being a strange Pig Latin thing; or maybe that's just a question of me getting more and more familiar

85
00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:45.960
with them

86
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.949
but I think there's more ... there's a tendency now to put English language instructions

87
00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.479
in the error messages and have suggestions of what to do ...

88
00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.500
but one of the thing's with a software bug is you might well get a backtrace and

89
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.690
I'm sure you're all familiar with that ... which

90
00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:02.850
tells us where things went wrong and what went wrong

91
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.000
... this is one of the things ... this is a

92
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.180
refresher for all of you. I'm sure you guys are all dealing with back traces

93
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.160
every day.

94
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.250
Certainly for the students coming into the MOOC

95
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.949
and indeed maybe new developers on your distributed team

96
00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.430
may not have ... I guess

97
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:25.229
one: the necessary experience with back traces to kind of use them to figure out

98
00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.280
where things went wrong or what went wrong

99
00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.100
... and they may often be sort of telling you "Oh, I just had this problem" and

100
00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.479
they won't show you the backtrace and well anyway

101
00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.050
more of that soon. Sometimes there's no backtrace

102
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.490
and that's when it's - a really good idea to check the log files

103
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.100
... a common issue from the MOOC was

104
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.270
people get an error in Heroku and you need to type 'heroku logs' to see the

105
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.860
logs files ... and I ...

106
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.120
actually that's an interesting one with Heroku in that

107
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.380
I would argue that maybe when you deploy your

108
00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.539
Heroku app by default it should have -

109
00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:05.139
you know - a set up so that the backtrace is

110
00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.720
displayed by default ... there's -

111
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.789
we can always sort of push this thing around.

112
00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:15.190
One thing overall as you know we're working with the tools that we have

113
00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:18.319
and ... we do the best we can. Actually from

114
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:21.669
Heroku there I've got an example backtrace

115
00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:26.060
that you may have ... easily have students

116
00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.830
encountering in the course ... you may have encountered yourself when

117
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.280
trying to deploy to Heroku;

118
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.990
and the problem with these stack traces and I've actually taken ... this is just a

119
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.910
portion

120
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.300
of the overall stack trace the came up during a Heroku deploy;

121
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.250
and the challenge ... which you've probably discovered yourself is that

122
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.250
there may be ... in there ... you've got like

123
00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.690
deprecated ... there's warnings that may be not critical and not related to the

124
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:51.780
failure that you had

125
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.610
... there's ... other bits of the stack trace

126
00:06:56.259 --> 00:07:00.410
which have a lot of the same information repeated because there was a nested

127
00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:03.449
calling operation and so on ...

128
00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.870
probably ... since you've reached this

129
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.449
point in the course you've ... and you've passed the previous courses

130
00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:13.580
you've encountered these sort of things before; but so it's

131
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.180
… but for a novice and for a junior developer

132
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.770
this can be like a horrible sticking point and you might say, "Well

133
00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:22.560
just search for it ...

134
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.360
on Google" and the temptation might be to take the entire thing and just say "I just don't know what's going

135
00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.610
on and there's this thing and it's like no no right, I .. it doesn't help and

136
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.610
look there's been an error on Google and just oh ..." I mean

137
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.319
this is the point at which we all need support; you've got

138
00:07:36.319 --> 00:07:37.169
you've got error

139
00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:40.550
compounded upon error. The approach as

140
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:44.740
I'm sure that all of you know is to kind of calmly work through this

141
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.830
and read "okay deprecation warning, you have a Rails 2.3 style plugins in vendor

142
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:53.080
support will be removed ... I mean part of thing is knowing that warnings

143
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.550
are there and won't be the source ... your main source of the problem.

144
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:01.080
A message look there's rake aborted could not connect to server, connection refused

145
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.250
is the server running on host ... and accepting

146
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.030
TCP/IP connections ... for me the

147
00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.030
instinct; okay that looks like the load-bearing

148
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.840
part of the error ... in this case the stack trace

149
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.440
NOT so helpful for telling me where things are going wrong, I know it's sort of -

150
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.930
its related to the database here. If I then go and search for that

151
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.800
in Google aha! Aha! There are Stack Overflow - I always love StackOverflow

152
00:08:26.419 --> 00:08:29.889
... posts because ...

153
00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:32.830
our great friends at StackExchange make sure that people are able to

154
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.909
vote the correctly

155
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:37.010
... correct answer or the most useful recent answer up

156
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:40.390
to the top and we find that there is actually a fairly simple fix

157
00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.019
for this. Although you can back up and say

158
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:47.730
well hey! And as I think as we

159
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:51.149
will be trying to do in this next run of the course is make sure that

160
00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.890
... things like this are pointed out.  I mean this actual error that I

161
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.060
got there is from a walkthrough

162
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:03.019
on chapter four from the text book ... let's just go

163
00:09:03.529 --> 00:09:07.140
into the ... virtual machine here

164
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:10.230
... and yeah it was part of a much

165
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:13.779
longer error and it's one of the things that if you, for example, if you do the walkthrough in chapter four

166
00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:14.769
and then you try and

167
00:09:14.769 --> 00:09:19.540
deploy MyRottenPotatoes to Heroku, unless you've set this particular variable

168
00:09:20.089 --> 00:09:24.019
then and I think we might have encountered the same issue in one of the earlier

169
00:09:24.019 --> 00:09:27.180
lectures ... let's get rid of that for the moment. Yes

170
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:30.830
yes so I mean there's ... we're also

171
00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:35.120
delivering this course doing our best to try and make sure that these

172
00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.100
issues are not encountered and that the ... to a certain extent the students can be

173
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.120
focusing on - you know -

174
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:44.160
the  - I guess you might say they're the "key" software engineering

175
00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.140
issues such as the red green and refactor and the behaviour driven development and so on.

176
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:51.290
We don't want people to be stuck

177
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:54.350
staring at this and saying I have to submit this homework or I have to get this

178
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:57.290
site out for my client and I just don't know how it works and the - I'm

179
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.040
stuck!

180
00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:01.810
... to the extent possible we don't want people encountering these things

181
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:06.529
but as ... we're using a real professional developer's stack here as time

182
00:10:06.529 --> 00:10:07.279
moves on

183
00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.350
... this one maybe we'll have fixed and all sorted for this next run of the

184
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.970
course.

185
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.300
I'm sure new things will come up. So part of what we're doing with

186
00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.870
the learners with the junior developers on our teams is scaffolding them through the

187
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.329
process

188
00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:24.200
of staying calm and learning the intuition of when things go wrong

189
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.190
what are the important parts of the information the computer is giving us

190
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:31.660
that we need to focus on ... if we go on

191
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:35.240
I mean this is diagnosing errors

192
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.649
... particularly with a focus on Rails

193
00:10:38.649 --> 00:10:42.190
views here ... which is -

194
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:46.040
it's fairly common in this course - we can put

195
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:49.510
instrumentation in the view so if we've got a running ... and I have

196
00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:51.250
got a running ... so like for example

197
00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:54.250
variable.inspect() or what have you we can ...

198
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:58.930
I've got set up to show the next slide but ... I've got a ...

199
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:02.110
if I just shut that down there; I've got

200
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:07.589
this is the MyRottenPotatoes as you would get to it at the end of

201
00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:08.459
...

202
00:11:08.459 --> 00:11:11.990
I've got confused about ... there's the editor; as you would get to at the end of the

203
00:11:13.459 --> 00:11:18.220
chapter 4 in here ... and we'll look at debugging the controller

204
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.220
again momentarily, but so if we look in a view ...

205
00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:25.040
let's go into a view and there's the index there so

206
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.040
I'm not such a big fan of HAML but we can do things

207
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:31.950
here ... actually is that set up for HAML ...

208
00:11:32.579 --> 00:11:37.269
hmmmm ... like variable.inspect() or debug variable

209
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.920
I'm probably going to end up ... well we might get an interesting error whatever I do here

210
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.370
... I wonder if it will let me ... see if I want to

211
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.540
get the code do I need to ... I need to do

212
00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:51.209
just like the percentage ... see I'm really not such a big fan of

213
00:11:51.209 --> 00:11:54.630
HAML. There can I do debug

214
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.250
@movies like so?

215
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:03.269
Ooh HAML ... and then see if I go and run,

216
00:12:03.269 --> 00:12:06.320
go and run the server there. 'rails s'

217
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.180
And then let's reload this and we'll ... at least we'll get ... even if it doesn't do what I expect

218
00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:14.459
we get a ... this is I mean in some ways this is ...

219
00:12:14.459 --> 00:12:17.920
at least here with this layout is giving us

220
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.290
more. It's not just throwing ... like Heroku might do at the beginning.

221
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.620
It's not just saying oh something went wrong, we don't know what it is and you have no idea

222
00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:25.850
where the log file is

223
00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:29.310
for that or what have you; but so we can see here

224
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:33.110
that yes, my debug operation there is not working

225
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.399
... we could just go and quickly and ask the question

226
00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.480
debug in HAML views

227
00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:42.920
... [HUMMING] ...

228
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.920
yep ...

229
00:12:47.279 --> 00:12:51.029
ah yes, HAML HAML HAML yes, I think what we need is we need critically

230
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:55.639
actually a tag that goes with it; so I think if we

231
00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:59.380
save that and rerun that

232
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:02.450
... yep, there we go

233
00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.250
so ... we're getting our page there we've also got

234
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:10.779
were dumping ... the debug output of our movies

235
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:15.639
movies there ... not a big fan of HAML myself

236
00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:19.220
but there we go; so that's yeah -

237
00:13:19.220 --> 00:13:22.769
we can be writing to the log file, we can raise an exception

238
00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:26.079
... my personal favourite really really would be ...

239
00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:29.870
these kinds of things are okay I would much rather use the debugger

240
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:32.870
to stop and examine the state of what's going on.

241
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:37.660
The debugger gem ... it's funny I personally never seem to need to use

242
00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.829
this running the rails server with the debugger like so

243
00:13:41.329 --> 00:13:44.329
but this is the kind of thing that I went through in

244
00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.529
my various ... I guess Helpouts

245
00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:52.660
or course ... I've forgotten what I call them but every week during the last course you may remember I

246
00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.540
was sort of

247
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.970
making myself available in hangouts to go through peoples' problems.

248
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.889
I think often the debugger, particularly when you're getting stuck on this debug

249
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:03.540
loop of changing some code and reloading everything

250
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.600
just like being able to ... and I'll just, at

251
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.290
the risk of repeating myself, if we go in here and we say that we look at

252
00:14:10.290 --> 00:14:14.040
at - as we it was earlier, if we go in here in the movies controller and we

253
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:18.110
place a debug statement in there I think I've already got

254
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:21.970
a debugger in the gem file ... yep

255
00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.500
in development and test ... and so if we've got

256
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:30.410
the debugger in there ...

257
00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:33.970
I think I've got ... I'll just shut this down ... I find

258
00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.519
the minus minus debugger seems to not be necessary. If I now run

259
00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.579
here ... I think we'll see that it gets stuck on the debugger there

260
00:14:42.579 --> 00:14:45.940
quite easily and I've now got this environment here

261
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:50.050
... I'm in a sort of debugger;  I can jump backwards and forwards in methods and so on

262
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.639
... in particular I can go into this sort of 'irb' thing and I can expect

263
00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:56.850
... sorry inspect, interactively

264
00:14:56.850 --> 00:15:01.060
what movies is at that point.  Oh it hasn't actually been run because the debugger stopped there so I could

265
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:01.660
even

266
00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:05.019
copy and paste a little bit of code ...

267
00:15:05.019 --> 00:15:08.449
fill in the variable there and I can do the movies

268
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:11.490
size and so on and having that full

269
00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:15.690
interactivity there in the immediate loop, so absolutely hugely hugely

270
00:15:15.690 --> 00:15:17.250
valuable, can save so much time

271
00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:20.639
... so one of the things ...

272
00:15:20.639 --> 00:15:23.850
generally I find often ... whether it's on a distributed team

273
00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:26.410
and they've got stuck on a cycle and I say "Oh let's jump in

274
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:27.260
with the debugger"

275
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:30.320
... whether it's a student online it's like

276
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:34.019
let's get in a Hangout and screen share and let's hang it on the debugger

277
00:15:34.019 --> 00:15:37.449
and actually see what's going on ... you can solve things

278
00:15:37.449 --> 00:15:40.820
very fast I think compared to these alternatives where you're

279
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:45.240
doing a lot ... inspecting things and so on but you know

280
00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.259
... the debugger has got more moving parts; there's other

281
00:15:50.259 --> 00:15:53.550
little things that you can run into for example that if you put ...

282
00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.990
the debug statement ... here

283
00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.220
instead of here, then it doesn't necessarily ...

284
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:03.690
that's ... kind of goes a bit crazy usually

285
00:16:03.690 --> 00:16:07.490
... always try and avoid debugger being at the very end of the line

286
00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:11.250
that you want to have it ... at least one before

287
00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.300
the end of the line, in my experience with debugging Rails and Ruby

288
00:16:14.829 --> 00:16:18.130
... so moving on ... so there's the tools

289
00:16:18.699 --> 00:16:22.180
... avoiding the bugs ... I can't ...

290
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.910
this is just huge like having ... automatic indentation

291
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:29.199
and highlighting to avoid syntax mistakes; that's ...

292
00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:32.920
I think ... I guess I use ... I lean on

293
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:36.250
automatic annotation less than I to used to

294
00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.779
I tend to be ... the VM that

295
00:16:40.779 --> 00:16:44.220
we distribute comes with this GEdit ... it's got

296
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:48.380
you know you get the tab width and so on set up. I don't think it has a function for

297
00:16:49.029 --> 00:16:52.079
auto-indenting all these things. If I'm

298
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.920
in my preferred -

299
00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.199
RubyMine - Do I have a RubyMine at hand? So yeah -

300
00:16:59.199 --> 00:17:02.630
I can be in some code and I think it's ... what

301
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:05.760
is this command is it like that to ... it

302
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.209
used to be that Eclipse was the thing that I loved for automatically indenting

303
00:17:09.209 --> 00:17:10.189
the code

304
00:17:10.189 --> 00:17:13.339
I think I now, oh yeah, there's reformat

305
00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:16.439
auto-indent lines, yes that's the

306
00:17:16.439 --> 00:17:20.089
is it actually the control-alt-L?

307
00:17:20.089 --> 00:17:23.390
control-alt auto-ident yeah... I end up not

308
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:26.569
oh goodness me I've accidentally

309
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:32.039
I think I've accidentally turned on inklet there by mistake ... I tend to rely on that less

310
00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:35.070
... the key thing for me whether it's automatic indenting or not

311
00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:38.480
is I just, I'm always making sure that my indenting is -

312
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.840
makes sense … and ... sometimes

313
00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.900
people I'm working with, or students, they've got ...

314
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:48.990
all sorts of crazy indenting things that just ... I think it's potentially

315
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.490
extremely confusing ... and that the highlighting I think these

316
00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.650
... the color-coding that you get in editors like RubyMine

317
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:59.320
and also you can get in simple editors like Vi; well Vi's not that simple, but

318
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:02.650
ASCII based editors like Vi and Emacs and so on

319
00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.679
just makes it hugely hugely

320
00:18:05.679 --> 00:18:09.370
easier to avoid these bugs.  Writing the tests before you write the code

321
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.039
that's one of critical things I think -

322
00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:16.530
you know, trying to ... asserting what it is that you want the code to do

323
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:20.960
... getting your assumptions out there ... doing it really properly test driven

324
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.080
... keeping it as absolutely simple as possible. Only ever writing

325
00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.740
application code ... the smallest possible amount of adaptation code

326
00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:31.380
in order to make your test pass is a great way of avoiding really nasty

327
00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.230
complicated bugs. This ... I'm still surprised at how many people ...

328
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:38.720
given a homework instruction, an assignment or a project ...

329
00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.820
in a distributed team, people just will say: "Right! Yes - let's build the entire thing

330
00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:42.919
let's let's let's

331
00:18:42.919 --> 00:18:45.580
do coding coding coding coding ... reams of code

332
00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:46.690
thousands of lines of code ...

333
00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:50.860
Oh right then we'll start testing now." It's ... write ...

334
00:18:50.860 --> 00:18:54.250
get down your assumption about what it is that you want to happen

335
00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.720
in the simplest possible test that you can, make just that test pass

336
00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:00.919
and then ... repeat, red, green and refactor

337
00:19:00.919 --> 00:19:03.919
... so yeah one unit of functionality;

338
00:19:04.559 --> 00:19:08.919
write the simplest code to get the code to green and then refactor ... I think that the complicated thing here

339
00:19:08.919 --> 00:19:12.250
is nesting that within the higher cycle

340
00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:15.220
the bigger cycle of the acceptance tests and maybe possibly even integration

341
00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:15.820
tests

342
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.510
... there's sort of cycles within cycles there. There's like at the very top level working

343
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:20.940
what are you building for your

344
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.900
customer or your user base ... what's the highest level

345
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:28.750
acceptance test of what's going on ... and having that up there and being -

346
00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.740
you're sort of bumping along at the bottom doing the individual unit tests

347
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.570
but sort of staying within that picture overall can save you

348
00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.210
huge amounts of times in terms of avoiding bugs but one of the critical things of course is getting

349
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.660
help

350
00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:44.809
... Dave and Armando come up with their lovely acronym R.A.S.P.

351
00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:49.030
for their ordering. I'm actually ... I'm kind of a bit

352
00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:53.640
… I'd almost be like R.P.A.S or something. I think I tend to

353
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:58.370
advocate posting a little bit earlier in in the sequence in some ways

354
00:19:58.370 --> 00:19:59.530
in that as much ... well

355
00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:02.760
or least clearly you should be doing search. First off ...

356
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.760
reading the error message ... even though you're busy and don't have time;

357
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.510
kinda building up this intuition for understanding error messages is

358
00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.600
... they're going to keep coming these error messages and the more intuition you

359
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.200
have about

360
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.780
how to deal with them the better ... absolutely ...

361
00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:21.220
if there isn't an error message, let's go and find the error message it's there

362
00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.230
in a log file somewhere

363
00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.870
... so then Dave and Armando are like ... next it's A

364
00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:29.080
ask a real person like ... if you're in an open plan office ... or

365
00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:31.940
if you've got ... you might be in a Google Hangout with somebody, who knows?

366
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.120
... and you're in a pair programming this is the ...

367
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.610
ask a real person. I mean there definitely ... that's certainly

368
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.470
... if you're pair programming and you're working on things together and an issue

369
00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:45.000
comes up discuss that with the partner. That's exactly ...

370
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.240
if a bug comes up in a pair programming session that's ... discuss it with them.

371
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:51.530
That's what you should be doing right? You can also ask

372
00:20:51.530 --> 00:20:54.580
in Skype chat or IM chat or whatever

373
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.580
else ... I guess sometimes the -

374
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.360
see partly why I ...

375
00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.630
I put these here, you can just ask straight away in Skype chat.

376
00:21:05.630 --> 00:21:09.900
In the case where you've got some error like this, rather than saying okay

377
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:14.510
you know taking that entire backtrace and then going over to Skype and

378
00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.900
saying: "Hey I got this back trace

379
00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:19.140
and what's ... I got this error, analyze this for me"

380
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.600
is kind of a little bit you're sort of dumping a lot of stuff on people. If you can

381
00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.309
take the time to read the error message

382
00:21:24.309 --> 00:21:27.679
and see this is the thing why I would say do the search first; like so we take the

383
00:21:27.679 --> 00:21:31.960
... we take the error message and do that search

384
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.150
... you can kind of almost save a ...

385
00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:40.500
its ... particularly if you can find the load bearing part of the error message

386
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.590
you can save so much time of just okay ... I mean and then there's the second thing of like

387
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.159
well

388
00:21:45.159 --> 00:21:48.289
can I interpret what's going on here ...

389
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:51.309
... the Stack Overflow I mean it's for ...

390
00:21:51.309 --> 00:21:54.059
as you become a more experienced developer that's just ... you're going do that

391
00:21:54.059 --> 00:21:54.740
anyway

392
00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:58.470
... and we want to encourage I think students and junior developers to do

393
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:59.360
this

394
00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.580
... as much possible and start getting to know that

395
00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.630
okay yes ... here this is like Heroku

396
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:08.659
... this is the Stack Overflow. These are the

397
00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.539
organizations and the places on the web that are gonna allow us to

398
00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:16.299
find the right stuff. Here we've got somebody else doing it in a

399
00:22:16.299 --> 00:22:20.200
... community forum which is ...

400
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.230
probably gonna ... like or Google Group [INTAKE OF BREATH]

401
00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:26.820
thats ... maybe that should be our second port of call or we look there if

402
00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:30.559
there's only ... that's all there is because ... you really wanna be going

403
00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:33.179
to ... what is it? This is a Heroku issue

404
00:22:33.179 --> 00:22:36.230
when we've been deploying to Heroku in this case

405
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:40.179
or StackOverflow, always a good resource ...

406
00:22:40.179 --> 00:22:43.289
and as the StackExchange for

407
00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:47.770
edX 169 comes up maybe that will start appearing in the search results, so that will be good too

408
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.909
... but so ... with these kinds of errors

409
00:22:50.909 --> 00:22:55.100
I would definitely advocate ... you might well search for them before

410
00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:56.309
you ask

411
00:22:56.309 --> 00:22:59.740
in the Skype chat and so then ...

412
00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:03.049
Google's your friend, there's StackOverflow. Then it comes to

413
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:06.480
posting and I say ... sort of asking in IM

414
00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.020
post ... if it's a really

415
00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.960
... I would say if you -

416
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:16.960
you've been searching and not finding what's going on

417
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.929
and it's a relatively simple thing; it's like oh this is just not working and you're

418
00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:22.010
in kind of like sort of a team, you're relatively

419
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:25.770
you know the team relatively well in your IM chat or Skype or whatever

420
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.909
... then you could just say: "oh guys I'm kind of sort of stuck on this

421
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:32.919
this thing ..." You haven't yet done a post. If it's like

422
00:23:32.919 --> 00:23:37.200
... it's maybe out of the class context but if you're a junior developer and

423
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:37.740
you're

424
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.360
working on something and you've encountered a relatively gnarly ...

425
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.730
stack trace and there's lots of little different bits and pieces

426
00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:48.409
and you're not sure ... it would be really good ... I guess it's sort of

427
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:53.620
... good manners ... maybe before ... it's a judgement call ... maybe before going on IM chat and just saying:

428
00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:55.500
"I have this thing", or kinda "Help me with it-"

429
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:58.500
... doing the post to StackOverflow,

430
00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.450
to a topic specific forum ... or in our case the class forum or what have you

431
00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:05.919
and then pasting the link into the Skype chat so that's ...

432
00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:09.610
you've kind of ... you've sort of showing people, doing people the courtesy of saying

433
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.799
"Rather just asking you to solve my problem - I'm showing you that I've kinda done

434
00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:18.460
a fair (amount) of the work to understand what the problem is and provide a context" and

435
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:19.080
so on

436
00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:22.640
and put that out there and then post the ... and then that's out there

437
00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:25.240
and then you post the link into the Skype chat and then maybe nobody's around

438
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.330
in the Skype

439
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.870
chat IM and doesn't respond, but then you've still ... you've already got

440
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:32.970
your thoughts and your thinking out and you've got a StackOverflow question out there

441
00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.260
and ... while you're then doing something else that could get answered. So I

442
00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:38.020
thinks that's

443
00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.309
a reasonable strategy ...

444
00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:45.760
... but for doing that posting, I mean it's

445
00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.600
good manners

446
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.130
to read your error message,

447
00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:54.179
have done some searching around ... this thing here it's yeah ... if you've got

448
00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:56.970
someone there or you are in a pair programming session and you can ask them immediately then definitely do that.

449
00:24:56.970 --> 00:25:01.020
You may be very isolated in which case ... fair enough you move to posting

450
00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:01.720
a bit earlier

451
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:05.400
... yes StackOverflow's very good, read their guidelines

452
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.890
... I mean the critical thing and ... again in the textbook

453
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.970
there's great coverage of this but ...

454
00:25:11.970 --> 00:25:16.549
so ... just saying "Oh ... the Sinatra gem doesn't work on

455
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:17.460
my system"

456
00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.890
there's not enough information for anyone here to help you ... "The Sinatra

457
00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:23.980
gem doesn't work on my system", attaches the 85 line error message

458
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:27.289
not so helpful again ... a bit more information. Best we've got this

459
00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:27.840
...

460
00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:31.169
actual transcript that's described in the book so

461
00:25:31.169 --> 00:25:34.340
somebody is - here is - they're described what operating system they're on

462
00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:39.070
... they're showing the sequence of things that they did

463
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:42.840
and they got this error. So this is ... this person here, Igor, has

464
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.070
really provided a good background on what he's trying to do.

465
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:49.070
You can see here within a very short amount of time

466
00:25:49.650 --> 00:25:53.610
people are asking some clarifying questions

467
00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:56.760
and I think within the hour ...

468
00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:00.010
a precise solution was found and that's

469
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:03.640
... it's good, although as Dave and Armando point out

470
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:08.260
in the book ... you're not going to get instant response

471
00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.220
on StackOverflow, it can be pretty fast.

472
00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.400
... but ... it should be ...

473
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.880
you should exhaust the other options first

474
00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.070
... definitely be polite I mean I think there's

475
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:24.679
the really easiest way to ensure that you don't get help

476
00:26:24.679 --> 00:26:28.690
and ... that actually people start attacking you and you start

477
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:29.870
getting into sort of a flame war

478
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:32.909
is to be really angry in your post and say

479
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:36.730
oh this software is driving me insane ... ah it's this, it's this and ahh ...

480
00:26:37.270 --> 00:26:40.620
I mean often we're in that mood where we're very frustrated when we're

481
00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:43.870
writing these things up on we're getting stuck on them ... but to the extent that

482
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:44.970
we can be polite

483
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:49.710
and even if we ... it just, I don't know I think you're just much much more likely

484
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:53.850
to get a quick response to your problem if you're polite and civil

485
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:57.630
... and also sensitivity to the developers. I mean the developers are also human

486
00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:00.510
... it's a bit like what happens in emails sometimes. We're kind of

487
00:27:00.510 --> 00:27:01.020
there

488
00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.200
and we say things maybe that we wouldn't say to people's faces because

489
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.120
we're sitting there facing the computer and similarly you know we have these

490
00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.350
bugs come up from the -

491
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:12.909
from the system ... whether we ... they're user interface bugs or

492
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:17.169
software bugs or whatever ... there are human beings who are working to try and build

493
00:27:17.169 --> 00:27:18.690
systems to do

494
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.309
different sort of stuff and as frustrated as we are with them;

495
00:27:22.309 --> 00:27:26.360
it's important that we kind of, are sensitive to the fact that they've been putting a lot of

496
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.570
effort into building things;

497
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:31.230
just because ... the thing that they've built doesn't do quite what you want, or hasn't

498
00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:32.549
worked for you

499
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:36.080
shouldn't be to completely undervalue their time

500
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.590
... even if they've made ... arguably they've made a mistake

501
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:43.140
at some point, they're still human and so sort of being sensitive to the

502
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:43.880
fact that they

503
00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.190
are putting a lot of effort into creating very often the open source systems that

504
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.860
we're using ...

505
00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:52.610
is going to go a long way towards ... endearing you towards the community

506
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:56.179
... but so going beyond sometimes as I sort of mentioned previously

507
00:27:56.179 --> 00:27:57.029
I think sometimes

508
00:27:57.029 --> 00:28:00.059
as much as we have

509
00:28:00.059 --> 00:28:02.919
considered and thought over and we've posted on StackOverflow and the discussion's

510
00:28:02.919 --> 00:28:03.760
going on;

511
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.140
maybe sometimes you're not going to get the answer that you want

512
00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:11.039
or in IM chat. Sometimes as I say video maybe worth a million words.  Shall I coin that phrase,

513
00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:14.390
is that my kind of trademark that and get some small amount of money every time some people say a

514
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:15.539
video is worth a million words?

515
00:28:15.539 --> 00:28:18.679
Doing a screen share is the way to go and

516
00:28:18.679 --> 00:28:21.960
we'll be strongly advocating students and TAs doing pair programming.

517
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.919
We'll be talking more about that very soon alright bye for now.
