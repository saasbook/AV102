00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.410
So let's just talk about generally ...

1
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.690
I've gone about - like - let's try and make sure all the discussion happens in the groups ...

2
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.700
let's try and moderate ... adjust

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.440
the length of our more posts to whether we're in IM or whether we are in

4
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.970
the Stack Exchange. The key ...

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.529
let's be civil and polite. I do my best I mean

6
00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.689
I

7
00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.810
.. if I'm ever not civil and polite you can like hold me back and say, "Sam, look -

8
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.279
you said in this slide that we should be civil and polite." I think it's ...

9
00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.300
I generally find this like ... often we all get frustrated and angry with

10
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.230
the technology doesn't do we want; people don't seem to be behaving in the way

11
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:35.390
we

12
00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:35.890
want them to

13
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.489
... generally if we get angry and frustrated and we let that boil over

14
00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.719
into how we interact with people

15
00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.329
we tend to find that those people are going to be less helpful;

16
00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.559
the people around us. If we're angry they're gonna be less helpful. I guess

17
00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.969
there's a kinda ...

18
00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.770
I mean this is maybe cultural there's maybe in some

19
00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.379
situations where unless ... maybe in some cultures maybe unless you are being really

20
00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:57.020
angry

21
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.820
you won't get a response? I think that's ...

22
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.350
yeah, maybe that's just the way it is and so maybe I have

23
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.930
to be accepting of

24
00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.640
some people are going to be angry sometimes ...

25
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.290
and thats

26
00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.390
culturally how they are? I guess I'm not a big fan of anger; I hate people

27
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.340
being angry at me; I don't want to be angry at people;

28
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.750
so I'm a big fan of the

29
00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.860
"Be civil and polite" and I think often ...

30
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.280
I don't know I think the problem is when people start getting

31
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.580
angry it raises the temperature; it gets

32
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:23.470
difficult to think.

33
00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.600
I think if we're all being civil and polite then

34
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.770
its easier for everybody to think and we can come to solutions more quickly?

35
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.210
Anyway so everybody ... we're all learners; whether this is a

36
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.290
distributed team

37
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.659
or a MOOC or what have you, we're all hear to

38
00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:39.869
learn; we're all

39
00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.229
trying to ... this is life right? Life is about learning we're trying to

40
00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.930
become ... better understand

41
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.579
how to make the most effective use the resources around us;

42
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.740
so let's be patient with each other; we're all trying to

43
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.500
learn; we've all got something to offer

44
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.189
yes and if we can be patient and civil and polite

45
00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.570
with each other we can discover what that is;

46
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.439
maybe ... so I mean I've already alluded to it;

47
00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.520
distributed teams, this course, the world TA Course

48
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.079
AgileVentures

49
00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.979
... span the globe; there are huge cultural differences, language barriers, all

50
00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:10.890
sorts of

51
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.349
things.

52
00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.730
Let's respect those and try ... I like to think about the human

53
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.129
race

54
00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.260
... the entire universe ... we're one! We're one big team

55
00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.800
although we may seem like we're going in different directions at different times, we're

56
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.160
one big

57
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.650
team

58
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.569
and I think that to the extent that we can honour and respect each other's

59
00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.930
differences

60
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.860
and see past those to ... we're all trying to

61
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.360
achieve wealth and bounty for all I hope

62
00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.860
then that's to all our benefit. So the key forum rules

63
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.610
really are

64
00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.300
let's be patient, let's be respectful, let's be civil and polite so let's

65
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.660
if people are ... if students for example in the

66
00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.989
in the MOOC are not respecting

67
00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.540
those rules - if members of your distributed team are

68
00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.660
not respecting each other - then I think gently but firmly

69
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.920
you want to remind people of say: "Hey that you know could be

70
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.050
misinterpreted, let's be sensitive there." It's

71
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.409
difficult it's ... we sort of

72
00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.659
say

73
00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.060
also moderate as little as possible. I mean that's kinda of like a

74
00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:07.970
judgement call;

75
00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.190
in any situation with a team whether its centralized or distributed

76
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.409
or it's online. I mean there's a particular thing I think about online courses

77
00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:16.489
online teams

78
00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.480
where particularly text in emails

79
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.940
... someone is frustrated ... it can easily be taken out of

80
00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.400
context. Things can get very heated

81
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.049
purely in email and we don't .. we try and avoid ...

82
00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:28.940
actually for AgileVentures

83
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.080
and also the MOOC we try and avoid using email where possible ... but

84
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.780
similarly within

85
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.750
forums like StackExchange and so on, what you thought of as a joke can

86
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.239
turn out to be something very offensive for somebody else ... it's just ...

87
00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.140
it's hard

88
00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.180
and I think I have yet to work out a list

89
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.019
or a little metric or a rule of thumb

90
00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.330
that will magically allow you to not offend everybody and so on

91
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.849
but so it's a kind of ... I think the key thing is to be going into every

92
00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:57.640
situation

93
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.629
calmly and if you're

94
00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.269
suggesting to someone that they might change their behavior for whatever

95
00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.280
reason that you want to do that

96
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.409
in a way that tries to ... that starts off by

97
00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:08.549
acknowledging their positive

98
00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:09.480
contributions. You say:

99
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.000
"that's a fantastic response but I think that that joke you made at the end might

100
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.659
be taken out ...

101
00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:17.750
might be offensive for some people and so on" and let's ...

102
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.269
the key really is keep talking ... if there's issue let's

103
00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.370
let's keep talking about it and hopefully we

104
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.120
can resolve it ...

105
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.900
so yeah I think I've kind of ...

106
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.300
I've kind of run ahead there. I mean to the extent that we have

107
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.250
questions running in

108
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.810
ongoing discussions going in sort of threads like this then

109
00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.720
you know if people are kinda like veering crazily off topic

110
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.350
like: "Oh yes I had this completely different issue that ... about something totally

111
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.759
unrelated

112
00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.699
but let me ask" ... that is going to be difficult for other people to find, like the

113
00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:50.940
title

114
00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:51.690
of this

115
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.419
topic is not particularly relevant anymore so we might want to say: "Hey oh that's

116
00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:56.500
a

117
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.850
very important question, can we move that over into a

118
00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:59.290
different

119
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.880
sub topic and so on" ... this is one advice that comes down from edX

120
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.740
"End conversations that are no longer productive". I mean part of the

121
00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:07.620
reason that I

122
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.340
am very keen on the chat environment and bringing that in

123
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.060
is I think sometimes it's good to just chat ... I mean you also need

124
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.560
to know

125
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.380
when to stop just chatting ... I guess if people ...

126
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.680
if people are just busy arguing about something and they're not listening to each

127
00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.030
other and they're just being unpleasant

128
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.039
and that creates a negative vibe then you want to kind of

129
00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:31.410
say: "Hey guys let's wrap this up or should we you know what should we do?

130
00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.430
Let's work out a way to finish it up." Yeah so

131
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.060
you want to get everyone to be civil.

132
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.190
If there are people duplicating threads ... I mean they'll be

133
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.700
a situation

134
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.700
...

135
00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.190
lots of people will be coming in who maybe haven't

136
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.160
used Stack Exchange before. They may

137
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.449
replicate additional questions in here

138
00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.800
so you might say "Oh this is a duplicate of this question, let's move the

139
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.650
conversation over there!"

140
00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:53.600
Perfectly reasonable thing to do ... and particularly point to people by

141
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.610
saying "Oh you know before you ask a question

142
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.729
do check using the search functionality to see if

143
00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:01.539
someone's already asked it, if the answers already there and

144
00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:03.259
do participate in the

145
00:06:03.259 --> 00:06:06.699
existing topics rather than starting new threads".

146
00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.550
So I mean that's kinda like more general I guess ...

147
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.370
station keeping ... when it comes to assisting learners and this might

148
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.740
be

149
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.419
another member of your distributed team who

150
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.680
is

151
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.490
... got stuck ... might be a

152
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.919
student that you're helping in a MOOC ... I mean

153
00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.759
I guess for the ...

154
00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:28.830
to the extent that it's a student who's really focusing their time on

155
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:34.729
on being a learner ... you kind of want to help them without revealing an answer;

156
00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.100
offer scaffolding and allow the ... we've talked about education

157
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.460
scaffolding

158
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.550
before which is not revealing the answer and basically allowing students to solve their

159
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:41.009
own problem.

160
00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:42.580
In a distributed team that might be different in

161
00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.050
that you - if your goal is just ...

162
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:46.199
to get something done as quickly as possible,

163
00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.710
you might ... with your distributed team you just want

164
00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:49.319
to tell the person that this is

165
00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.080
the solution

166
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.740
... I guess that's maybe the key difference between the

167
00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.770
people who are coming and saying "Right, I really want to

168
00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:58.050
learn here", although

169
00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.860
that has a place as well in distributed teams in that ...

170
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.300
what you kind of want to do is not have a situation where

171
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.949
other team members are just dependent on you for answering questions all the time

172
00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.590
... what you wanna do is try and help all of

173
00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.520
your team members

174
00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.030
build independence ... generally

175
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.370
one of the reasons that we're trying to train as many

176
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.949
TAs as possible is to provide timely answers in the forums ... if

177
00:07:22.949 --> 00:07:23.410
you can

178
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.280
get in there and give an fantastic and that's

179
00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.190
a general rule I think with a distributed team

180
00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.050
as well, the quicker that you

181
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.819
can get feedback

182
00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.240
the happier people generally are; although of course

183
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.539
we can't be perfect and then I think as regards

184
00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:42.259
to students ... if they're just asking for

185
00:07:42.259 --> 00:07:44.860
general things about "I don't understand what Git is? I mean you

186
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.520
can help explain that but you can also say "Hey, you know, look - why not

187
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.720
do a search for git textbook or here's a relevant

188
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.410
links to be looking at and so on", but the key thing generally is

189
00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:58.900
I guess if they've got a course specific question

190
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.520
then ideally you help students

191
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:04.259
as a TA in the forums, in the chat, in the Hangouts,

192
00:08:04.259 --> 00:08:05.020
instead of saying

193
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:08.460
online search ... I mean ... there's this issue that as we know the

194
00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:09.000
homework answers

195
00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.729
are kind of out there ... it's

196
00:08:11.729 --> 00:08:16.569
... the whole reason to put the course in place is to help people

197
00:08:16.569 --> 00:08:16.940
learn

198
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.009
actually if you're just looking up the answers online you're not ... you're kind

199
00:08:21.009 --> 00:08:24.879
of undercutting your own learning ... so I think we wanna

200
00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:28.419
generally be clear about how ... that we shouldn't be sharing

201
00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:30.330
answers with each other. It's all about this we

202
00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:31.789
want to help each other learn. We want to

203
00:08:31.789 --> 00:08:33.180
scaffold each other rather than just

204
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.500
allow people to copy answers

205
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:41.930
verbatim ... if you're in a position to answer a question do

206
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.120
answer it

207
00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.540
... general points ...

208
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.800
make sure that your information is correct. If you are unsure about

209
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.860
your information do check with others

210
00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.600
first; particularly as regards the upcoming course

211
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.300
then do complete assignments in a week in advance and

212
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.019
you will know what's going on ... similarly with distributed teams

213
00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.320
sometimes if you're too hasty in jumping in offering

214
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.750
advice when it may be the wrong one that can undermine the team activity

215
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.500
and particularly from the course side of things encourage

216
00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.800
learning and reading and also particularly pairing ... I'm a big big fan of

217
00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:21.080
pairing; we'll talk more about that later in the lecture sequence this week.

218
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.300
So here's kind of like a set of

219
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.540
little guidelines from ... we've

220
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.070
pulled together from the ... our experiences in

221
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:30.580
in the MOOC

222
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.230
so far which I think

223
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.779
also refers to managing communication with distributed teams;

224
00:09:37.779 --> 00:09:40.529
that's - sometimes there's going to be language barriers; so

225
00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:43.720
sometimes you'll need say, "Right, I wanna rephrase it

226
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:47.990
I'm gonna try and use examples" ... there's courseware issues

227
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.820
... so there's gonna be for any given

228
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.810
assignment there's gonna be common problems

229
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:59.080
... I'll try and give your a prep on those week by week as we go through

230
00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:01.769
... if you can do the

231
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:04.579
homework assignments in advance that would be

232
00:10:04.579 --> 00:10:05.950
very helpful ...

233
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:07.940
sometimes students will come in saying ... I mean as you can imagine this is

234
00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.240
customers coming into a distributed

235
00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:11.470
team and saying: "Look, well we've tried to install your software on this other

236
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:16.390
unsupported OS or IDE" and the situation there is to be polite and say

237
00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:21.070
"Yes we're focusing on supporting

238
00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:24.470
these platforms with the VM and so on" and so …

239
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:28.160
Sure, if you can help them solve that issue ... but prioritize people

240
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.959
who are having issues with the courseware and recommend to people doing

241
00:10:30.959 --> 00:10:32.620
alternate stuff that they should use the courseware

242
00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:36.660
because that is trying to make our own ability to manage everybody's

243
00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:40.119
issues ... manage them more effectively

244
00:10:40.119 --> 00:10:43.760
... if you don't know the answer .. come and talk

245
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.170
and we'll work it out ... this is one of the great

246
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:51.430
opportunities - a student may be exploring some aspect of some

247
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:52.870
issue that you hadn't got into when you

248
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.880
did the course previously so this is an opportunity for your own learning

249
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.350
... if the student's gone off there - out into the blue

250
00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:03.410
if they're off doing their "yak shaving activity" ...

251
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.230
you wanna say: "you seem to be getting right off track and

252
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.870
let's see if we can get you back to the right place"

253
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.810
... and then also there's ... as you're aware we have the autograders which

254
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:13.390
will grade

255
00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:15.990
student homeworks ... and

256
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:20.370
sometimes students will say, oh it's the autograder that's not working ... often it's actually

257
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:20.769
some sort of

258
00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:21.389
homework issue

259
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:24.050
... or I mean I'd certainly say that we've got

260
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.850
issues with the

261
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.790
autograders and sometimes the error messages they

262
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.490
give are difficult to interpret

263
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.240
that's something

264
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.510
we're trying to fix but ... if it does seem that the autograders are down

265
00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.399
then the key thing is to let me know as soon as possible and do that

266
00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:36.990
through

267
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:40.529
Skype chat ... so

268
00:11:40.529 --> 00:11:44.839
finally we've got helping students solve problems efficiently

269
00:11:44.839 --> 00:11:48.640
... there's going to be times ... when they've installed ...

270
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.190
they have installation issues so look out for ...

271
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.070
skipped or incomplete steps ... if they haven't mastered the directions and this is

272
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.160
the

273
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.720
kind of situation sometimes where it can take a

274
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.450
long time in chat to work out what's

275
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.820
going on but if you're in a Hangout

276
00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.180
and they show you oh well I did this and I did

277
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.329
this and they can show you the history of their

278
00:12:04.329 --> 00:12:08.120
activity on the UNIX command line you can see oh yes you didn't do this

279
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.459
this one thing or that thing and

280
00:12:11.459 --> 00:12:14.870
if they have ... their homework is failing ... look

281
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.950
out for the student including features that weren't required

282
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:21.450
that they're touching the wrong bits of the code ... they're having

283
00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:21.709
trouble

284
00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:25.579
interpreting the exception error messages ... and actually you say ... I

285
00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.639
say this -

286
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:29.870
I think this comes up in distributed teams all the time ... working with

287
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.570
... the client has done a spec and the developer working on

288
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.959
the code says: "Oh yes we could use this and we could use this" and

289
00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:42.170
so this is the skills of the TA

290
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:44.050
not so different from that of a project manager of

291
00:12:44.050 --> 00:12:46.120
a distributed team

292
00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:49.089
you need to be helping your developers focus on so …

293
00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:51.600
exactly the parts of code they need to be focusing one so ...

294
00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.680
you're getting a real value for money, as it were, putting your time as a

295
00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.430
TA

296
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:59.860
I think it really does ... I'm constantly. agonizing about: "Oh no we're doing too many

297
00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.170
things with this course we're teaching you about

298
00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:02.870
distributed teams, we're teaching you about being a TA

299
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:09.250
I think there is a lot of overlap; but yeah so that's communicating effectively in online

300
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:09.640
forums

301
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.380
... I hope that's helpful and I look forward to communicating with all of you in

302
00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:15.670
the online forums as the course goes forward. Alright, bye for now.
