Hi there and welcome to ESaaS Managing Distributed teams and the question on everyone's lips,

1
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.530
or at least on the lips of this slide, if it has lips, is what is this course about?

2
00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.839
So this course is about a number of things.

3
00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.490
Perhaps first and foremost it's about learning how to manage distributed teams;

4
00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.580
that's teams of people working, where team members are in a number of different locations.

5
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.640
We're thinking particularly about teams working online in different places around the world.

6
00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.509
However we have some other agenda items in terms of delivering this course.

7
00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.400
The skills of managing distributed teams are going be very useful for anybody who wants

8
00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.130
to be a teaching assistant (or TA) in the BerkeleyX computer science 169 course which

9
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.940
is a very popular online course for software engineering and Agile development using Ruby

10
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.980
on Rails.

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.840
Already many thousands of students around the world have completed this course and we're

12
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.330
looking for people to be teaching assistants, which as well as solidifying your software

13
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:54.380
engineering skills is a great way to practice your distributed team management skills.

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.810
We're also hoping to prepare you to collaborate on Open Source projects.

15
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.440
Particularly those with AgileVentures and more on each of these three things as we move

16
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.270
forward

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.250
Lets go to the next slide which is all about distributed teams;

18
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.219
so the traditional office environment you have people in a room or a couple of rooms

19
00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:14.799
or maybe on a few different floors of an office;

20
00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.340
and that's how people have worked for quite a long time.

21
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.810
Of course there's phones and more recently instant messaging systems which have invaded

22
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.460
the office,

23
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.570
but the big difference now is the presence of high quality video networking tools that

24
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.939
are freely available such as Skype, Zoom and Google hangouts.

25
00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.950
These tools make it possible for people in multiple locations around the world to operate

26
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.979
almost as if they are in the same physical location.

27
00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.030
We're getting more and more new tools and technologies to help with communication and

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.840
collaboration around the world and in this course we'll give you an overview of the different

29
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.950
tools and technologies that are being used;

30
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.939
as well as how you can get the best use of them in order to support your own distributed

31
00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.039
teams;

32
00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.990
to work with teams of students online;

33
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.289
to work on open source projects and so on.

34
00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.350
The thing the we want to emphasize is for any of these tools, and also for technologies

35
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.909
like the individual programming languages and so on, that these things will come and

36
00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:05.670
go.

37
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.610
The specific tools and technologies are critical to focus on because without them we can't

38
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.790
get specific about how we do things now.

39
00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.390
However, underlying everything else are these key aspects of communication and collaboration

40
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.080
... in 5-10 years time maybe there's going to be a different set of tools, a different

41
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.670
set of programming languages and frameworks around, but the interpersonal skills that

42
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.750
you need to manage and work with people;

43
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.100
those are eternal and those are ultimately the critical things to take away from from

44
00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.260
this course.

45
00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.060
So that said we do have this upcoming worldwide course and many thousands of students will

46
00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.690
be coming online and taking BerkeleyX's very successful software engineering course, now

47
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.990
called "Agile Development using Ruby on Rails" .

48
00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.900
Already 10s of thousands of students have taken this course in order to be introduced

49
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.180
to tools like Pivotal Tracker, Heroku, Github and to get to grips with Ruby on Rails and

50
00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.010
Agile development.

51
00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.710
This is a very very popular course that goes through all these modern software engineering

52
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.430
techniques and tools and it's particularly focused on Ruby on Rails and in order to help

53
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.320
those many thousands of students we need teaching assistants;

54
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.070
people who are available to be online and help those students as they master all this

55
00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.680
new material.

56
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.820
We'll talk more soon about just how valuable and rewarding it is to be a Teaching Assistant.

57
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.340
To finish up this section let's talk about Open Source projects.

58
00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.940
So our other motive here is we believe strongly in Open Source, where you can see all the

59
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.900
code in a software system.

60
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.840
This is a great thing for collaboration because anyone can get involved in fixing things or

61
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.290
adding features.

62
00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.840
We particularly believe in Open Source for non-profit projects but there's Open Source

63
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.900
used by for-profit ventures around the world and of course you don't need to talk to us

64
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.620
in order to know how to get involved in Open Source.

65
00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:43.860
There are many existing Open Source projects, however the collaboration in many of those

66
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.100
projects will be text based and asynchronous.

67
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.250
Given the great stellar consolation of different Open Source projects that are out there you

68
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.120
might ask yourself which one do I get involved in, who do I talk to about what's going on?

69
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.960
This is exactly what we've set up Agile Ventures to help with.

70
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.680
It's an Open Source project incubator which helps people get together to work on Open

71
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.620
Source projects both asynchronously and synchronously through Remote pair programming and online

72
00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.370
scrums through systems like Google hangouts.

73
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.400
It's all free and open and the greatest benefit is that you can see the Agile development

74
00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:14.910
process for real.

75
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.449
Participating in an Agile Ventures project is a great way to see how the Agile development

76
00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.959
process works in the distributed environment.

77
00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.900
To summarize in this course you'll learn a lot about the process of managing distributed

78
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.400
teams benefiting from our experience of the last several years of working with the students

79
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.340
and TA's in the online CS169 course and the various ongoing AgileVentures projects.

80
00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.749
Those Open Source projects have been and continue to be a huge lot of fun and I very much hope

81
00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:43.270
you'll enjoy the rest this course, as we learn about distributed teams in the context of

82
00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.860
managing online classes and open source projects. Alright, bye for now.
