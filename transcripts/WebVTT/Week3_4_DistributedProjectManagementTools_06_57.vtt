00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.270
So let's talk about Distributed Management tools and

1
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.410
these are I think - are not so dissimilar from

2
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.809
normal management tools or at least these days, with everything presenting a

3
00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:11.559
web interface,

4
00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.610
in order to make them easy to use, then the things that you would use to manage

5
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:18.480
a distributed team given the tools that are available online

6
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.029
are very similar to the ones that you would use for a centralized or co-located team.

7
00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.160
The particular ones that are bouncing around in the front of my cortex

8
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.170
at the moment are many things that you will already be familiar with

9
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.480
such as a Wikis, Google Docs;

10
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.750
here I am in Google Docs; Pivotal Tracker we're big fans of

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
Pivotal Tracker; and there's others that we've ... various

12
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.860
people on our team have had different experiences with, there's like Jira, Trello, Asana:

13
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.860
all different tools for sort of tracking the

14
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.030
tasks that you've got to do ... what gets done, who's doing it and so on

15
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.690
and in some ways the ... default thing is

16
00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.960
... in order to do shared work

17
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.440
you just need some kind of something you know

18
00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.030
a document that you'll be able to pass around and so

19
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.540
for example; I keep thinking back, I can remember

20
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.729
a setup where the planning document might have been in a Word document

21
00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.360
and that might have been emailed round to people and

22
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.290
you know that maybe it would end up getting stored in a version control

23
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.390
system and the problem

24
00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.790
with those kind of things is you know, again whether you're a single team in a

25
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.540
single office,

26
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.619
or spread out all over the world, just visibility

27
00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.290
is a terrible problem so and you know people "Oh it's in the

28
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.820
Word document", "Where kind of is that?" If you've got and everybody's got browsers running all the

29
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.259
time -

30
00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.790
if you've got a Wiki ... like we've got an example here GitHub Wiki

31
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.409
you know it's a simple as saying "Oh right, yes I need ...

32
00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.420
some information on let's kind of go, here AgileVentures, LocalSupport"

33
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.689
and I go to my LocalSupport Wiki

34
00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.860
there and I've got some information and ... basically

35
00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.360
anybody can start updating and trying to fix problems in that and we've got

36
00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.799
great visibility there.  So that's kind of like a great default

37
00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.360
thing ... tends to be I mean - you know there are restrictionsâ€¦ You

38
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.460
know Wikis usually have various restrictions

39
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.009
on formatting ... Atlassian who produced Jira they also do

40
00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.260
you know an enterprise grade Wiki ... you get more,

41
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.540
I guess the more you pay for it more bang you get your buck ... although GitHub

42
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.430
Wikis

43
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.930
... we have Wikis for all of our AgileVentures products

44
00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.720
... Google Docs provides more formatting options:

45
00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.239
for the development of this class we've got a shared

46
00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.800
google doc folder that's got all the slides in it, everybody on the team can edit any of the slides at anytime

47
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.620
... we've got this great thing in Google Docs as you're probably aware

48
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.349
there's great features to show; have I got something down here, no one else looking at this slide

49
00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.849
at the same time as me, but it shows you when someone else is looking at the

50
00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:45.310
same

51
00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.410
... the same slide to try and help you avoid editing

52
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.700
two things at the same time ... you know so you can kind of get away

53
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.060
to a degree with Wikis and Google docs and so on ...

54
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.849
I guess - beyond the Wiki at least - you've got your issue tracker

55
00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.209
which often shows up in the pull requests; pull requests; where's my issues gone ...

56
00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.310
graphs, network, bu du du der, LocalSupport go back

57
00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.550
... do we not have a ... because normally pull requests become

58
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.980
I can see that there, mmm, maybe we don't actually ...

59
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.659
we don't use I think ... I notice quite a few ... I mean there's a fantastic

60
00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.069
issues ... I think we have some ... yeah, there we go

61
00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.159
... there's a ... I think many projects don't

62
00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.810
don't tend to use GitHub issues as a tracking system.

63
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.110
It's certainly there; some do

64
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.450
and the issue tracking there is great ...

65
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.750
we tend to use Pivotal Tracker across the board and rather than me

66
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.690
explaining Pivotal Tracker to you which your

67
00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.680
at least partly familiar with we've got two videos from Pivotal Labs

68
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.069
in the next two sections showing a general introduction to

69
00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.330
Pivotal Tracker and a more detailed

70
00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.879
you know how Pivotal Tracker works with the whole sort of Scrum process

71
00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:01.120
and so on ... Jira as a paid tool; I don't have so much experience with that

72
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.519
... other members of our team

73
00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.590
you know, like it; other groups I know swear by it; I know people who prefer

74
00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.920
Trello, I know people who prefer Asana

75
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.260
... they've all got their relative pros and cons

76
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.699
but one of the things that we notice about all of these things is basically that they're

77
00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.370
available

78
00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.240
over the web ... available transparently ...

79
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.410
I mean this is the key for managing all of our projects as you can

80
00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.150
see here

81
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.669
I've got all the different AgileVenture projects that are ongoing, here, I can jump to any of them

82
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:30.160
quickly.

83
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.160
Anybody, you know, we just pass the link around, anyone can see it anyone can get in

84
00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.550
there

85
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.020
and see what's going on ... also particularly relevant to

86
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.229
the 169 class - if I go and look up through the

87
00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.250
the whole projects here - in terms of managing the content for the MOOC

88
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.740
we've always used ... (that's autograders

89
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.350
which is also for the MOOC but 169, there we go); so for example

90
00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.340
we've got here in previous runs

91
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.930
of the MOOC we've tracked all of the issues

92
00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.800
and bug reports and so on about the course

93
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.270
through these trackers ... and we did and we were at one point running

94
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.520
sort of competitions for who could file the most reports.

95
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.810
I believe I've already created one for ... here we go, so this is

96
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.190
our next run ...

97
00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.150
so this - this is something that ... we'll get all of the

98
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.919
TA's

99
00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:24.320
signed up to as members - and then for you know

100
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.520
triage obviously we can discuss issues in the stack exchange forum, which

101
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.780
we've now got up and working; I mean sort of I haven't really mentioned

102
00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.880
forums in particular there because we'll have more on the forums

103
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.330
next week but obviously issues can be kind of triaged and discussed

104
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.580
and so on in the forum but

105
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.440
ultimately in terms of generating like work that has to be done by somebody

106
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.060
... so this is like something I know I'm just going to have to do

107
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.850
for the new course ... it can be you set there -

108
00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.319
(and I know that just has to be done so let's just pop that over there)

109
00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:02.030
... I think Pivotal Tracker is a great

110
00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.600
online free resource and we'll be using it

111
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.210
for managing the MOOC. I think it's a fantastic

112
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.000
tool for supporting Scrum, the whole Agile

113
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.259
process generally as you can see we use its extensively

114
00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:20.530
for all of our AgileVenture projects and

115
00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.080
yeah so I'd strongly encourage you to watch the next couple of videos introducing you to Pivotal Tracker

116
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.569
if you're not

117
00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.970
already fantastically familiar with it

118
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.740
already. It is of course introduced, in part, in the 169 course

119
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.400
and then we'll have an assignment to get started making sure

120
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.240
everybody's signed up as a member for this so that's as you go into being a TA

121
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.819
in the 169 course that we can coordinate

122
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:47.690
the work that needs to be done to fix various issues

123
00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.690
in the class to make sure that the students have the best

124
00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.979
course available to them.  Alright bye for now
