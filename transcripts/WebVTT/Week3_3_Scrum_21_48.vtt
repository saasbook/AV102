00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:03.889
Right so let's talk about Scrum and about managing your team, being in a team

1
00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.529
being in a Scrum team and this material is

2
00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.790
I think generic across whether you are in a co-located/centralized team or a distributed

3
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.300
team

4
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.179
and it's probably a refresher for many of you. We've all heard

5
00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.850
bits and pieces about Scrum ... it's also material

6
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.510
that crops up in various places in the 169 course. You can't really hear about

7
00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.070
about modern software engineering without hearing about Scrum and Agile.

8
00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.179
Scrum focused on -

9
00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.160
really - about the management side of things rather than necessarily the

10
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.870
software

11
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.120
components. Scrum can be applied more broadly than that

12
00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.329
... the key thing that it's trying to do is help you manage

13
00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.730
complex problems and effectively deliver quality products

14
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.690
whatever they are

15
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.750
at the end. I think I haven't yet

16
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.070
found anybody who argues that Scrum is

17
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.120
complex to understand. I think what can be difficult is actually applying it

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.870
and getting it to work.

19
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.460
We've got three main principles of Scrum:

20
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.909
One is the transparency; everybody in the team

21
00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.760
... not that they are constantly bombarded with everything that's available but that they

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250
can at least in principle

23
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.430
see the other things ... see what's going on. You can see the results of

24
00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.759
meeting. I think one of the ... I mean you know in larger organizations there's a

25
00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:19.939
tendency to say

26
00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.939
right you know we should treat other groups as a black box. We

27
00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.659
shouldn't be able to see

28
00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.659
what's going on there. The danger with that is that you end up with

29
00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.829
these bottlenecks on communication and it's difficult to get

30
00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.360
get things done; but - so one of the Scrum principles is transparency;

31
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.320
actually with AgileVentures we go for global transparency ... because we're doing sort of

32
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.270
nonprofit projects

33
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.950
and so on, we basically ... we hold ... we live stream

34
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.869
all of our meetings, all documentation, all the code, all the pair programming, everything

35
00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.119
is completely live streamed and recorded and we can see it anytime.

36
00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.720
So yeah I think there's nothing like total transparency

37
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.259
to achieve total transparency ... to other things

38
00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.700
principles of Scrum: Inspection ... you want to be keeping on

39
00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.320
reviewing the process that you have because

40
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.030
it's going to need to adapt ...

41
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.270
the ... I think the whole

42
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.959
Scrum and Agile approach is less prescriptive it's less saying do precisely this and

43
00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.459
then you will get precisely this result

44
00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.560
it's a set of guidelines that say you know

45
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.530
... let's go in this direction ... let's try this out

46
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.810
see how it works for you and your particular circumstances and keep

47
00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.330
reviewing

48
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.670
and keep coming back and trying to make changes and trying to get - you know - regularly be

49
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.390
measuring,

50
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.390
inspecting the outcome. Is it working? Are things working as they

51
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.840
should?

52
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.510
Are we making progress? So you know keep on making changes in order to achieve those

53
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:42.220
goals,

54
00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.849
so in line with those suggestions when you - when you're doing a Scrum

55
00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.230
you've got these particular ... I guess the roles in particular

56
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.360
so we've got Product Owner and Scrum Master along with the rest of the

57
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.909
development team whoever else is involved. So the product owner is

58
00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.110
is going to be the champion for the

59
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.930
customer as it were and try and sort of take their side, try and

60
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.450
focus on their needs and the Scrum Master is gonna try and focus

61
00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.920
on who's ... the actual logistics of running a scrum and these different sorts of meetings

62
00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.550
in the Scrum

63
00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.519
cycle and so on ... and then there's everyone else who's involved

64
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.190
and these ... the role that you're in whether you are just one of the team members, whether you are the Scrum

65
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.180
Master, Product Owner

66
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.900
as I think Dave mentioned in the 169 course you know that can rotate

67
00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.459
and can change.  Different weeks different people take

68
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.540
different roles; it can be somewhat fluid

69
00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.569
... but the key thing is this Scrum cycle we've got here

70
00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.129
and the idea is that we've generated through some mechanism

71
00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.780
stories about what it is that the customer the end user would actually like

72
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.860
to have available in their

73
00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.120
product ... of course we're sort of focused on software here

74
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.180
but it could be you know ... that it would be

75
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:58.409
let's say for example you're delivering an online class ... that's

76
00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.950
your output.

77
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.269
It could be that, oh I don't know, that you're writing a textbook, it could be

78
00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:02.900
that you're

79
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.959
designing an advertising campaign ... we're focused on software here but

80
00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.680
the Scrum is generic over all different types of

81
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.019
activities that you might be doing but so you get you know

82
00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.669
ideally in the beginning sort of brainstorming; right we've got all these things

83
00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:17.940
that it would be great to have

84
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.410
... you know there's a process of working out; right, what can we fit into

85
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.919
a sprint and we've got down here, is it, thirty days and that can vary

86
00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:29.360
and its like what could we .. what would be the meaningful set of

87
00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.419
features for the sprint,

88
00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.780
for a single sprint that would maybe produce our MVP or minimum viable

89
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.910
product for us and you've got this sort of longer

90
00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.540
cycle which is the bigger sprint cycle and then you've got a daily

91
00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.630
Scrum cycle within there and we'll go through that in some

92
00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.139
more detail in the next slides. So ideally the sprint

93
00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:54.280
is between 1 and 4 weeks and depending upon your project constraints and this that and the other

94
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.800
it's gonna be ... that's going to vary

95
00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.560
different times are going to make sense.

96
00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.690
You ideally want to be producing some releasable

97
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.870
increment ... its ... if you're not

98
00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.110
actually pushing something out that can be evaluated by somebody

99
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.680
on the outside of your team then it's not really

100
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.030
a sprint and you can if someone turns around and says "right, that

101
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.710
entire thing that you guys were building

102
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.270
you know, right, is no longer needed, right" then let's be willing to cancel it

103
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:27.229
anytime.

104
00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:30.229
But so the sprint will consist of

105
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.990
planning the sprint; we think it should be one week, 4 week, what

106
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.520
have you

107
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.340
... then daily Scrums; crucial I think this is the bit ... this is my favorite

108
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.530
I think this is my favorite bit really of Scrum ... it's almost where the name comes from

109
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.530
is the idea that you have these short meetings daily and you just kind of

110
00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.639
work out quickly

111
00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:49.770
what's going on and where you ... coordinate people and

112
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.180
it shouldn't take very long and really what it's trying to avoid is like this period

113
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.750
where you might not see somebody for two weeks and then you find out that you've been

114
00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:56.910
working at cross-purposes

115
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:00.120
that entire time ... actually obviously doing the work itself

116
00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.650
and then there are things that happen ... you know where you

117
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:07.870
review and you do retrospectives and so on and so well let's - let's talk through

118
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.110
some of these different bits and pieces. So the Sprint Planning event would be

119
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:12.199
where you come together

120
00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:15.949
and you decide what to do and how do it and

121
00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.810
I get this very like ... it shouldn't take more than eight hours. I

122
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:20.500
think often people allocate a day

123
00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.509
to do this ... depending upon your organization

124
00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.280
this is going to be ... I think critically it shouldn't be that you

125
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.020
spend

126
00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.720
two months working out ... a six-month a plan

127
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.270
it's right let's spend no more than a working day,

128
00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.319
ideally less, working out what we might do over the next one to four weeks

129
00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:41.919
and just sort of allow ourselves to

130
00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.600
fail or succeed fast and keep learning and iterating ...

131
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.100
so yeah and I think I've a

132
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.970
little slide malfunction there. So the key thing about the

133
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.460
Sprint Planning event is that it should generates a sprint goal

134
00:06:57.229 --> 00:07:00.250
and a backlog of tasks so

135
00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.050
example goals would be things ... a description probably a bit more detailed than this; I just got

136
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.000
sort of short ones

137
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.229
to fit into the slide here but these goals would be

138
00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.500
you know some feature or something that we might

139
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.229
add to whatever product that we're working on that's realistic

140
00:07:15.229 --> 00:07:18.750
to achieve within the next one to four weeks. Can we get it done with the

141
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.690
resources that we have

142
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:22.690
available to us and that's kind of a guess and then also right

143
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.800
for that higher-level goal, you know a backlog of

144
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.319
different stories that would allow us to ... I guess that's ...

145
00:07:29.319 --> 00:07:33.080
stories, tasks and so on.  We talked about user stories last week

146
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.280
... that would allow us to achieve that high-level goal

147
00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:40.699
... so yeah this is you know an important

148
00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:44.379
kicking off - kicking off the - the initial sprint in order

149
00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:48.710
to work out what one is going to be focused on, and we'll see

150
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.620
more examples of this ... just debating with myself here about whether

151
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:53.490
to go

152
00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.490
Pivotal Tracker which we'll talk more about the next section

153
00:07:56.490 --> 00:07:59.690
but we can sort of see ... particularly like a backlog

154
00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:03.310
of particular things in ... this is I mean I love

155
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:06.610
the public Pivotal Tracker access you can see

156
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.660
the backlog for all of the different AgileVentures'

157
00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.240
projects there and we ... it's an ...

158
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.310
ongoing thing. So that ... when we ... I just wanted to link that there.

159
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.949
When we say you're generating a backlog it's ... you're generating a series of

160
00:08:20.949 --> 00:08:21.539
tasks,

161
00:08:21.539 --> 00:08:24.979
users stories, these chores that we talked about last week ... that's gonna be

162
00:08:24.979 --> 00:08:28.520
... help you achieve whatever is your releasable

163
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.019
element at the end of your week or two or three or four

164
00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:35.190
week sprint. So then the key things we talked about before is the daily Scrum

165
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:38.760
... so this is what you know happens the most

166
00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.070
... it is only you know part of that process.

167
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:45.290
I think often and what we find in AgileVentures is - it can,

168
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.860
things can sort of collapse to end up just being about the Scrum; because that's the regular thing

169
00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:49.420
that's where

170
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.100
everybody talks. It can be, depending on your organization, difficult to organize the planning

171
00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.279
events, the review events

172
00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:57.440
and so on ... but anyway this is

173
00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:01.290
you know kind of ... I still say it's kind of the key

174
00:09:01.959 --> 00:09:05.470
independently of anything else that you do ... I mean the idea is

175
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:09.200
you wanna be repeatedly reviewing what's going on,

176
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.680
changing approaches ... ideally it will only last 15 minutes;

177
00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.570
that can be really hard ... there's these three questions

178
00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.709
that you have, it's like, what have you done; what are you planning

179
00:09:19.709 --> 00:09:23.220
to do and what, if anything, is blocking you. I think we might just add this in

180
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.050
so it's

181
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:27.050
what have you done ...

182
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.370
question mark log ... what are you doing

183
00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:37.620
and we can say "any blocks?"

184
00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.769
and this ...

185
00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.050
done face-to-face ... there's this idea of a stand-up meeting to try and

186
00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:48.130
particularly to keep it short and stop people getting relaxed

187
00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.149
everybody stands up and you know they go around the room

188
00:09:51.149 --> 00:09:54.589
and you do that, and - of course then depending on the number of -

189
00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:58.399
people, does it end up taking more than fifteen minutes? And there's lots of like breakout

190
00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.420
discussions that

191
00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.890
might happen. In the distributed Scrum

192
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:05.910
... as we do in AgileVentures ... that's all being done

193
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.630
over Google Hangouts or Skype or what have you

194
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.240
... we've found there's an interesting

195
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.430
variations you can, depending on the number of people involved and the number of

196
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:17.709
projects; we tend to have

197
00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:20.769
multiple projects on the go; is you can do a people-focused

198
00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:24.010
Scrum or a project-focused Scrum ... I mean our

199
00:10:24.010 --> 00:10:27.459
whole non-profit volunteer framework with AgileVentures

200
00:10:27.459 --> 00:10:30.829
allows people to sort of ... there's no requirement

201
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:34.839
to be at every single meeting. People make time and they're

202
00:10:34.839 --> 00:10:37.870
available as and when and so

203
00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.870
depending on the number of people in the meeting and what's going on with the

204
00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:41.230
projects; we might

205
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:45.070
go around each person and say what have you done? what are you doing? are there any blocks?

206
00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:49.180
... we might say oh we've got quite a lot of, a large number of people, ten people in the Scrum today

207
00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.180
... let's do a project focused thing and we've got about you know generally

208
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.190
4, 5 or 6 active projects in AgileVentures at any given time and we would go through

209
00:10:57.190 --> 00:11:00.680
and the question would then become, to kind of the project leader for each

210
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.640
of those, would be

211
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.140
what's ... happened on your project? What's

212
00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.529
... the next step and you know is there anything

213
00:11:08.529 --> 00:11:11.579
blocking you? ... and then it moves towards this

214
00:11:11.579 --> 00:11:16.089
idea of Scrum of Scrums, which I think as we're increasing in size at

215
00:11:16.089 --> 00:11:20.240
AgileVentures we're kind of moving towards that but we're still at kind of this

216
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.360
intermediate stage where we're jumping backwards and forwards between people-focused Scrums

217
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.070
and project-focused Scrums.

218
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:28.519
Of course it's different in and organization where you know everyone is being paid

219
00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:32.269
to be there and everybody has to attend the meeting at the beginning of the day

220
00:11:32.269 --> 00:11:35.910
and you can decide on which ... the number ...

221
00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:39.220
there is a much more executive control of this sort of thing

222
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:43.880
you know it's gonna be I think likely to be more people focused unless it's ...

223
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.510
you've got this sort of Scrum of Scrums where you've got daily Scrums are

224
00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.000
happening for the individual developers on their own

225
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.440
projects and then one person like the - who would be the Scrum Master - would

226
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:54.519
be reporting back

227
00:11:54.519 --> 00:11:58.060
in this sort of Scrum of Scrums format on the larger-scale

228
00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:01.670
... so the challenge generally is keeping it to fifteen minutes ...

229
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:05.079
it does, I mention in the previous section, you want to kind of allow

230
00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:09.940
well you know ... I wanted to say you want to allow about a tiny bit - a smattering(?) of

231
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.980
small talk. I mean I think that depends

232
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.870
partly on ... how the team feels about it. It depends are you

233
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.630
actually

234
00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:21.810
all going to bump into each other on the water cooler,

235
00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:25.269
in IM chat or what have you ... yeah it's a

236
00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:31.110
... you don't want to be so rigorous with this 15-minute limit that

237
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.850
you fail to

238
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:36.930
work out ...resolve some little issue about the person having a

239
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:37.470
block.

240
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:40.870
I mean the key thing really is that ... for the -

241
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:44.120
for the Scrum with the five, six, seven or eight people or

242
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.820
what have you is that in principle if they're paying attention

243
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:51.110
everybody should at least hear approximately what everybody else

244
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:54.320
is kind of on at the moment and

245
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.610
you know if people have got any blocks. This is the key thing really is about asking

246
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.779
about if there any blocks?

247
00:12:58.779 --> 00:13:01.990
Because you know if one person's stuck on using a particular kind at tool

248
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:05.860
and someone else and say: "oh yes, no no, I used that yesterday and I saw that sorted it out and

249
00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:06.660
I can help you".

250
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.660
What you wanna particularly avoid is

251
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.360
then deep: "like, right, let's get the computers out, let's

252
00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:14.680
solve that problem in that meeting"

253
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.440
No! it's like: "okay, yes, John and Bert you'll be talking after the meeting and

254
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:21.790
you know take that off separately". So that's this you know you want

255
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:24.490
the high-level; you want to get into enough detail so people understand

256
00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.600
what each others' blocks are

257
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.200
but if it's going too far then that's the particular job of the Scrum Master

258
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.339
to make it happen; say like "look alright

259
00:13:33.339 --> 00:13:37.019
yes that's fantastic we have connected you two. Lets take this offline and

260
00:13:37.019 --> 00:13:40.360
... arrange another meeting for that" and try and move on so

261
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.449
whoever's in the meeting can (move on) ... because the problem is

262
00:13:44.449 --> 00:13:44.709
that

263
00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:47.940
you don't want to spend all your time in meetings, you want to be getting work done as well.

264
00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.240
Another thing which is of course is making things happen on time

265
00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.050
and this is ... the Scrum Master really

266
00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.630
needs to work hard to make sure they happen on time and that

267
00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:01.760
they are limited and ... yeah that

268
00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:04.829
allows work to get done but

269
00:14:04.829 --> 00:14:08.220
members the team to sort of communicate with each other and help each other

270
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:11.500
because what you ... when  you think about the alternative where you're

271
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.079
working

272
00:14:12.079 --> 00:14:15.110
largely independently from somebody for two weeks and you spent

273
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.779
forty-eight hours being blocked on something that the person two desks down had

274
00:14:18.779 --> 00:14:22.730
fixed the other week ... particularly in the distributed environment

275
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:26.480
... you haven't got quite the same bumping into people at the water cooler

276
00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.370
... and so on. So doing the Scrum effectively online;

277
00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:35.100
extraordinarily important. So then other events that you might have are the

278
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:36.630
Sprint Review event.

279
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:40.290
So once the sprint has been done and you've released stuff,

280
00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:43.810
the idea is this shouldn't take more than four hours, maybe two meetings

281
00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:47.000
... this would have the product owner

282
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.320
and also the stakeholders involved

283
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.839
and you'd kind of be reporting back to say you know what is being done;

284
00:14:53.839 --> 00:14:57.019
what should be done next ... and

285
00:14:57.019 --> 00:15:01.079
yeah you need to sort of demonstrate the product - what you're ... what you've

286
00:15:01.079 --> 00:15:01.829
produced

287
00:15:01.829 --> 00:15:04.829
and so you need to be able to do that within the time constraints, usually

288
00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:08.440
four hours, unless it is a very complex product then that should be enough ... and then also how to

289
00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:08.870
demonstrate it

290
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:11.889
without being boring. I mean that's just, I think you know ...

291
00:15:11.889 --> 00:15:15.010
can people be trained not to be boring? I'm not sure ... its

292
00:15:15.010 --> 00:15:18.550
you just ... need to make sure that when you're, for example, explaining

293
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.959
something to the stakeholder who's the interested

294
00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:21.699
customer

295
00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:25.199
you're not telling them all about the the details of the new continuous integration

296
00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:26.370
system that you've got working

297
00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.990
its about showing them the things that are important

298
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:32.990
to them and

299
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.959
yes so I mean as an example on ... what we have

300
00:15:36.959 --> 00:15:40.600
... in LocalSupport, which is one the biggest AgileVentures projects -

301
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.709
we kind of have the customer meeting, I guess as our Sprint Review

302
00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:48.089
events every week and so we have our

303
00:15:48.089 --> 00:15:51.490
... we actually do that in always less than an hour.

304
00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:56.240
It never takes more than an hour I think and I guess we're on a seven-day

305
00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:00.540
cycle there to make that work so then there's also

306
00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.540
the retrospective events which is

307
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:07.130
you know ... the Review event is sort of you're presenting to the

308
00:16:07.130 --> 00:16:07.779
customer

309
00:16:07.779 --> 00:16:11.130
the Retrospective event is more where you're saying right okay the methodology

310
00:16:11.130 --> 00:16:12.329
that we use -

311
00:16:12.329 --> 00:16:16.699
you know our Scrum seem to be going you know bleeding over to like 20 minutes 30

312
00:16:16.699 --> 00:16:18.329
minutes on a regular basis

313
00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:21.839
... you know I couldn't access the

314
00:16:21.839 --> 00:16:25.139
backlog frequently enough, the management tool for

315
00:16:25.139 --> 00:16:26.620
tracking about backlog

316
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.420
was going offline ... all these sorts of things I mean

317
00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:33.720
that to try and ... you don't want to be you know

318
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:36.730
given that you've worked out some process to go through the sprint you don't

319
00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:38.540
want to be blindly repeating that sprint

320
00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:41.639
and hitting the same issues and issues again and again. of course

321
00:16:41.639 --> 00:16:45.149
those things can come up in the daily scrum. You've got like

322
00:16:45.149 --> 00:16:48.990
an individual block here might be related not just to the technology

323
00:16:48.990 --> 00:16:51.459
that you're working with or some particular product;

324
00:16:51.459 --> 00:16:56.000
they're to do with blocks "I keep on spending all my time in meetings and I can't bear it" or

325
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.920
what-have-you so there's an extent to which

326
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:01.370
some of these issues might be highlighted in the daily Scrums and might even be resolved

327
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.780
in follow-up meetings after those. It's

328
00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.490
yeah a sensible thing to sit down

329
00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:11.669
and review the methodology. And this is something that we have

330
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:14.789
had trouble regularly doing our respective events in

331
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:18.169
AgileVentures where it's a volunteer staff and we've got everybody

332
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:21.480
involved being volunteers, having their time constrained and so

333
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.530
its you know they can attend the daily scrums and - you know - and

334
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.500
an interested subset will be involved in the Sprint Review event but the

335
00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:30.030
...

336
00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:33.419
the Sprint Retrospective event is much harder to

337
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:38.820
... make time for, although very important ... we have with AgileVentures kind of a

338
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.179
weekly meeting which is longer

339
00:17:40.179 --> 00:17:43.840
in one of the usual Scrum times which serves as a

340
00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:47.910
planning slash retrospective event;

341
00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.650
but yeah, so another thing that's important is a Backlog Refinement event

342
00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:54.780
and at that's not necessarily a separate event but

343
00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:59.190
you know you'll find over time, as we have done, that you end up with

344
00:17:59.190 --> 00:18:02.240
things in the back log, a huge icebox a process of

345
00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.640
adjusting all of these things and working out you know

346
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.309
sometimes I find we do this actually with the customer to a certain extent, because of course we're looking

347
00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:09.870
at

348
00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.960
the backlog; are these features still relevant

349
00:18:13.539 --> 00:18:17.900
... checked ... have the priorities changed

350
00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:21.890
and so on and ... fitting

351
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:26.400
in a separate meeting for this is challenging

352
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.850
... yeah but ...

353
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:33.669
I think the way we do it, at least with the LocalSupport project, that's just one project in

354
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:34.520
AgileVentures,

355
00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.830
is that we try and have Backlog Refinement as a regular aspect

356
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.590
of effectively what's our Sprint Review meeting with the customer ...

357
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.750
... so I've kind of been mentioning

358
00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:51.539
various aspects of the distributed Scrum. This is probably like you've all

359
00:18:51.539 --> 00:18:55.030
heard about Scrum before many times, I think it's mentioned in some detail in the 169

360
00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.799
course,

361
00:18:55.799 --> 00:19:00.090
there's lots of materials online ... there's a fan(tastic) ... Distributed Scrum

362
00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:03.360
there's a fantastic book from IBM with all proceeds going to charity;

363
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.940
a practical guide to Distributed Scrum. I mean this just goes to show that

364
00:19:07.539 --> 00:19:10.740
Scrum ... it's not just

365
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.169
crazy start-up hotheads who are trying Distributed Scrum;

366
00:19:14.169 --> 00:19:17.530
this is IBM with thousands of employees and

367
00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:22.429
locations all over the world ... distributed scrum really it's taking the

368
00:19:22.429 --> 00:19:24.230
whole Scrum and just doing it online!

369
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:27.320
It's as simple as that! I mean there are all sorts all those issues that come up

370
00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.070
... to do with particularly ... time zones. I think time zones is one of the

371
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.090
most challenging things

372
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:35.840
but as I mentioned I think in previous sections and I'll keep mentioning it again because

373
00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:41.030
I ... to be honest I am starting to find being a Hangout where everybody can

374
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.419
share their screen instantly

375
00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:46.160
is actually ... I would almost rather have my scrums

376
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.160
online ... as long as everybody's got a good internet connection

377
00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.650
... and you can see all of the Scrum activity that we're doing

378
00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:56.260
online at AgileVentures ... all the time. If I just go ... I mean I've got a little

379
00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:59.840
clip from the website ... basically we have

380
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.020
this series ... we have scrums and then pair hookups going on

381
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.770
just constantly really its every 4 or 5 hours

382
00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:10.299
around ... twenty-four/seven at different times

383
00:20:10.299 --> 00:20:13.710
and you can jump in and see a Scrum taking place and

384
00:20:14.409 --> 00:20:18.669
this sort of pseudo scrum of scrums as we review, as we

385
00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:19.280
work through

386
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.460
using Pivotal Tracker to manage all of our activities. So in fact one of your assignments

387
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:24.720
this week

388
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:27.760
will be to come and join in the scrum and join in if

389
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:32.070
you can with voting on some features for one of the

390
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:35.370
AgileVentures projects to see: "Scrum in action!!"

391
00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:39.409
... yes indeed and personally I think

392
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:43.280
the combination of the Scrum approach the constant review

393
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.650
and the new technologies that allow all this stuff to take place online

394
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:51.190
is just extraordinary and ... its ...

395
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:55.490
there's a big cross over with the with the MOOC and the

396
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:58.490
169 course which I think has elements of this ...

397
00:20:59.039 --> 00:21:02.919
there's an extent to which, yeah we may ... we're toying with

398
00:21:02.919 --> 00:21:03.419
having

399
00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:07.169
specific TA MOOC Scrums

400
00:21:07.169 --> 00:21:10.320
... more on that next week

401
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.590
but so do also check out some other resources. There is a a free online book

402
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:17.350
about Scrum and XP there. This is the link there to the

403
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:21.630
IBM book there. There's also a technical paper from a few years back showing how

404
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.900
distributed Scrum could be extremely cost-effective and lots of other

405
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:25.799
resources

406
00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:28.909
out there on the net ... so

407
00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:33.039
what can I say, I think, scrum seems to work very well for us we're enjoying

408
00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:36.970
developing lots and lots of features for our customers

409
00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:41.309
very fast through AgileVentures and I know many other bigger organizations than we

410
00:21:41.309 --> 00:21:44.710
are doing so ... come and jump in

411
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:45.409
Alright, bye for now
