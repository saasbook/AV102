Hello! And welcome to week three!

1
00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.870
It's time to talk about distributed team management.

2
00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.320
So before we get into all that good stuff; let's just talk about what's going on this

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.369
week.

4
00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:14.719
So we're going to talk about various things this week;

5
00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:19.090
many of the techniques we talk about are just as valuable for centralized team management

6
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.039
or co-located team management.

7
00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:24.679
Although many of them are *particularly* valuable in distributed settings.

8
00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.349
I'm going to tell you as much as I can to connect them to work we've been doing in a

9
00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.329
distributed framework, such as the MOOC, and all the stuff with AgileVentures.

10
00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.970
Some of what we'll talk about this week is still reviewing some topics that you'll know

11
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.640
already from having taken the ESaaS MOOC.

12
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.220
It might have been a while since you went through the MOOC so a little refresher shouldn't

13
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.420
hurt.

14
00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.670
Also you'll be explaining many of these things to the students.

15
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.980
The students will have questions about these, so it's good to go over them again.

16
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.380
However we do have new material that's not in the 169 MOOC and the undercurrent here

17
00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.870
is really all about managing Distributed teams.

18
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.840
In particular it's about how we're managing the volunteer nonprofit distributed teams

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.210
through AgileVentures.

20
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.110
Other people have been running distributed teams in one form or another for a lot longer

21
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.030
than we have;

22
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.080
so we don't claim to be the world's foremost experts on this.

23
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.360
Nonetheless we're got several years of experience with making distributed teams work.

24
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.500
The MOOC's coverage of software engineering in the cloud and working with teams does stress

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.220
the importance of teamwork.

26
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.480
But unfortunately the online MOOC doesn't have the equivalent of the team projects they

27
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.280
do at UC Berkeley.

28
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.950
However that's going to change with the introduction of 169 part 3 MOOC projects class; exciting

29
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.020
stuff!

30
00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.500
In the meantime let me give you a bit more of an overview about what we've got coming

31
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.580
up in the next few videos.

32
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.200
So we're going to talk about Agile, particularly distributed Agile.

33
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.630
We're going to talk about Scrum, with a bit of a reference to distributed Scrum; where

34
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.159
I think Scrum works particularly well.

35
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.990
We're also going to talk about distributed management tools like Pivotal Tracker and

36
00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.670
friends.

37
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.970
We'll talk about pair programming, remote pair programming, and other collaborative

38
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:00.380
patterns.

39
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.640
We've got a lot of materials this week; even more so than last week.

40
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.310
We've got extra videos from other sources; for example for Pivotal Tracker we've got

41
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.849
introductory videos provided by Pivotal Labs.

42
00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:14.700
For the pair programming as well as me evangelizing and waxing lyrical;

43
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.319
we've also got various links to other resources and embedded videos from other speakers on

44
00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.989
pair programming.

45
00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.200
I think there is probably more material there, than you could reasonably cover in one week.

46
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.870
Don't feel that you have to cover all of it.

47
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.959
I think if at a minimum you just watch the main lectures from me, and then you can dip

48
00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.480
in to the other ones as appropriate.

49
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.230
Next we'll move on to GitHub pong and the mechanics of how to do that.

50
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.799
Then finally we'll talk about GitHub for teams and this is super useful stuff, that is pull

51
00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.269
requests, merging, cherry-picking and so on.

52
00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:48.849
I apologize in advance if our coverage doesn't do justice to just how powerful and how useful

53
00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:49.999
these techniques are,

54
00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:54.109
but we have got me doing a live pull-request and associated merge in the actual video,

55
00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.340
which I hope gives you a flavour for it all.

56
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.989
Again I wish I had had time to re-record all the videos.

57
00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.809
I've settled for adding transcripts to all of them that I hope will suffice for the time

58
00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:05.549
being.

59
00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:09.739
I must say that any deficiency in the materials and recordings is down to me personally.

60
00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.849
I'm hugely indebted to the full AgileVentures team who've worked behind the scenes to get

61
00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.450
all these slides and quizzes and everything sorted.

62
00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.669
Like open source software I think this course is incrementally moving in the right direction.

63
00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.489
I'm hoping that what comes through is the wonderful time we're having in AgileVentures

64
00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.609
collaborating online; managing our distributed team.

65
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.059
We very much hope that our experiences can help you in your journey.

66
00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:37.529
So please, if you find anything that you'd like different in this course do let us know;

67
00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.049
and feel free to get involved to help us improve it.

68
00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.120
All the people, the entire AgileVentures team, are all people who've graduated from the 169

69
00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.319
MOOC, just like yourselves.

70
00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.090
They're just folks interested in the topic material and all working to keep learning

71
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.370
more about how to succeed as software engineers and as a distributed team.

72
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.180
I look forward to continue seeing you in the chat, where we've got some great discussions

73
00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.099
going on relating to last week's assignment.

74
00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:59.260
Alright, bye for now.
